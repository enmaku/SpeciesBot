Queensnakes *Regina septemvittata* are medium sized (38-61cm, record 92.2cm) New World natricine snakes that range from southern Ontario, Canada, and northern Michigan south to coastal Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, east to western New Jersey and Delaware, and west into western Arkansas.  The distribution is patchy and some populations, especially isolated ones, are under significant pressure from habitat alteration.

*R. septemvittata* are semi-aquatic and feed almost exclusively on freshly molted crayfish.  As a result, they are generally restricted to areas where crayfish are abundant.  Favored habitat is forested streams and rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms, but a variety of other water bodies and wetlands are utilized, sometimes even in urban areas, so long as prey is available.

Queensnakes have keeled scales usually arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  The anal scale is divided.  Their dorsal background color is some shade of brown (yellowish, olive, greyish, or chocolate), with a yellow lateral stripe located on the 2nd and adjacent part of the 1st scale row,  extending to the lower face.  

*R. septemvittata* are sometimes confused with other, sympatric natricine snakes.  The closely related Graham's Crawfish Snake *R. grahamii* has a broader lateral stripe which occupies scale rows 1, 2, and 3. Glossy Swampsnakes *Liodytes rigida* have no lateral stripe and proportionally larger, "buggy" eyes. *Thamnophis* gartersnakes and *Tropidoclonion* Lined Snakes have undivided anal scales and usually a middorsal stripe. *Nerodia* watersnakes have at least 21 dorsal scale rows and proportionally larger heads.
