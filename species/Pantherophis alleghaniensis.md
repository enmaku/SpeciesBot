Central Ratsnakes *Pantherophis alleghaniensis*, formerly called *Pantherophis spiloides*, are large (record 256.5 cm) common harmless ratsnakes with a multitude of regional color patterns native to eastern and central North America between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River Embayment. *Pantherophis* ratsnakes are keeled-scaled generalists that eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, and are particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.

Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis* are currently recognized as distinct from Eastern Ratsnakes *P. quadrivittatus*, as well as Western Ratsnakes *P. obsoletus* and Baird's Ratsnake *P. bairdi*. Parts of this complex were once generically labeled "black ratsnakes". Use the "!blackrat" command without the space for more on these changes.

Ratsnakes can be easily distinguished from racers *Coluber* by the presence of keeled scales. Racers have smooth scales.
