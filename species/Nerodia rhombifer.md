Diamond-backed Watersnakes *Nerodia rhombifer* are medium to large (~110cm, record 175.3 cm) natricine snakes with heavily keeled scales often found in and around water. Heavily aquatic compared to other watersnakes, they are commonly encountered fish and amphibian eating snakes across much of Central North America south through Guatemala and Belize.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

Found throughout central North America, it is sometimes confused with other watersnakes or its sister species the Brown Watersnake *Nerodia taxispilota*. *N. rhombifer* has a reticular, net like pattern resembling a chain link fence and adults often have a orange, vibrant eye. Geographic range helps determine species, but *N. erythrogaster* has is its namesake plain belly that varies across the range from yellow to orange. Banded Watersnakes *N. fasciata* have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In Common Watersnakes *N. sipedon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body as in *N. erythrogaster*, but has a patterned belly. *N. rhombifer* and *N. taxispilota* can look incredibly similar near where their ranges meet, in which case geographic location can be used to determine species.

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods.
