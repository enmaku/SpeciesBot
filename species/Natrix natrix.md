Grass Snakes *Natrix natrix* are small (54.1-83.5 cm record 205 cm) harmless natricine snakes with keeled scales. They and their sister species the Barred Grass Snake *N. helvetica* are the most commonly encountered snakes in Europe. Grass Snakes are active semiaquatic foragers - their diet consists mostly of amphibians and fish. This taxon covers wetlands across a large geographic extent and recently phylogeographic analyses have revealed crytic species within the complex.

Recent work shows that two species of grass snake speciated in separate refugia and have expanded out since the last ice age (pleistocene), with the Rhine in Germany serving as a biographraphic seperator between two species, with snakes west of the river elevated to their own status as Barred Grass Snakes *Natrix helvetica*. See the range map for details.
