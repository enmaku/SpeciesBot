Chicobolus spinigerus, commonly known as the ivory millipede or Florida ivory millipede is a millipede species native to the southeastern United States, occurring across the Florida panhandle as well as southern Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.

Males tend to be smaller than females, measuring 40-85mm (1.6-3.3in) while females are typically closer to 90mm (3.5in) in length. It is more reliable, however, to determine the sex of this species by looking at the 7th body segment behind the head. Females will have a normal 7th body segment, whereas this body segment on males will have gonapods instead of legs.

Because they are easy to provide optimal habitat conditions for, breed readily, live socially, and grow to a good size, ivory millipedes are common in the exotic pet trade, and most offered for sale are thus captive bred individuals from private collections.

Like most millipedes, Chicobolus spinigerus are detritivores and primarily susbsist on rotting wood and leaf litter. Although this species (and millipedes in general) are considered harmless, they may be toxic if consumed and can excrete toxic substances when alarmed. Always supervise young children to prevent accidental ingestion, and be sure to wash your hands after handling any millipede.
