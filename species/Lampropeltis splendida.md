Desert kingsnakes *Lampropeltis splendida* are large (90-114 cm record 152 cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the getula species complex. Desert Kingsnakes range from west of the Trans-Pecos and east of the continental divide, overlapping with the California Kingsnake *Lampropeltis californiae* at the Cochise Filter Barrier. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes are immune to the venom of the species on which they prey. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range.
