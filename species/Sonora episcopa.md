Groundsnakes *Sonora episcopa* are small (21.5-30.6cm, record 48.3 cm) North American colubrine snakes that range through much of the central US and part of northern Mexico, from west-central and south-central Missouri west into southeastern Colorado, south into west Texas, Coahuila, MX, and back east into east Texas.
  
*Sonora episcopa* are harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. They inhabit a wide variety of arid and semiarid habitat, especially those with loose or rocky soils.  Semi-fossorial in habit, their diet consists of centipedes, spiders, scorpions, insects, and other invertebrates.

*Sonora episcopa* lay eggs.  Their dorsal scales are smooth, glossy in appearance, and arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The anal scale is divided and a loreal scale is present on the face.  This species formerly included *S. episcopa*, from which it can't reliably be differentiated morphologically, and *S. taylori*, which can be differentiated by having only 13 scale rows at midbody.  It is best differentiated from *S. semiannulata* and *S. mosaueri* by range, but the precise boundaries between *S. semiannulata* and *S. episcopa* in southern NM, southwestern TX, and Coahuila, MX have yet to be resolved.
