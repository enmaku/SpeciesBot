Broadbanded Copperheads *Agkistrodon laticinctus* are the westernmost of two recognized species of copperhead. Adult Broadbanded Copperheads are medium-sized  snakes (56-76 cm record 95 cm) that live in a range of habitats, from terrestrial to semiaquatic, including rocky, forested hillsides and wetlands. They can also be found within cities where wooded areas are present, such as city parks. They also will hang out where there is deadfall; [their camouflage is perfect for this!](https://www.wilx.com/content/news/Viral-photo-shows-copperhead-snakes-amazing-camouflage-420376274.html). When young, Copperheads are known to readily consume cicadas as a major part of their diet. As they grow they switch to larger prey like small mammals and amphibians.
 
 
The bands on Broadbanded Copperheads *Agkistrodon laticinctus* do not narrow at the top of the snake and are usually [contrasting copper or brown cross-bands on a light tan background](https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/2212102/original.jpg?1438470172).

Broadbanded Copperheads are venomous but usually only bite humans or pets in self-defense. As with many banded snakes, their first line of defense is to flee. Copperheads also shake and vibrate the tail in self defense and as a caudal lure.

The *Agkistrodon contortrix* species complex has been delimited using modern molecular methods and two species with no subspecies are recognized. There is a wide zone of admixture between the two copperhead species where they overlap.
