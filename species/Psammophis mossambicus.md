East African Olive Grass Snakes *Psammophis mossambicus* are large (100-150cm, up to 180cm), mildly venomous, psammophiid snakes that range from northeastern Congo (and adjacent Democratic Republic of the Congo) and northern Uganda south along the coast to central Namibia in the west and east-central South Africa in the east, from sea level to 1,500m.  They primarily inhabit moist lowland within a wide variety of broader ecotypes, including riparian corridors, grassland, scrub, and open woodland, but will also utilize disturbed areas such as agricultural plantations and gardens.

Rear-fanged snakes, *P. mossambicus* are mildly venomous, but generally considered harmless to humans.  Envenomation is uncommon and usually mild, but prolonged, chewing bites should be avoided as a precaution.  They are extraordinarily wary, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and harassed**.  Diurnal in habit, these active, swift moving, and vision-oriented hunters prey primarily on lizards.  Snakes, rodents, and insects are also consumed.

East African Olive Grass Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 8 supralabials, an elongate loreal, a preocular, and usually 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is usually divided.  They are closely related to the similar West African Olive Sand Snake *P. phillipsii*, which replaces them to the west.
