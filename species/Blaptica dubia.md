Blaptica dubia, also known as the Dubia roach, orange-spotted roach, Guyana spotted roach, or Argentinian wood roach, is a medium-sized species of cockroach which grows to around 40-45mm (1.6-1.8 inches). They are sexually dimorphic, with males having wings covering the full length of their bodies, and females having only tiny wing stubs. Adults are dark brown to black and sometimes show lighter orange spots. Coloration varies across habitats, colonies, and individuals.

Dubia roaches are found in South America, with specimens documented in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. They are also a common feeder insect, so captive colonies are frequently kept by reptile, amphibian, and tarantula enthusiasts in many other locales.

Blaptica dubia are ovovivaporous, with the female giving live birth to 20-40 nymphs after their eggs hatch within her body. Each female can produce this many nymphs on a monthly basis, given favorable conditions. While the males have wings and can perform controlled glides, they are not capable of proper flight, nor can they climb smooth, vertical surfaces due to the lack of a fully-developed arolium.

Dubia roaches are frugivores and will preferentially seek grain and fruit-based sources of food, though protein-rich foods may be consumed if offered. 

In Canada and some U.S. States, Dubia roaches are considered a harmful invasive species and as such importation by the general public may be banned or illegal.
