Western Black-Tailed Rattlesnakes *Crotalus molossus* are medium-large (76-107cm, up to 133cm), stout-bodied rattlesnakes that range from northwestern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico southeast to central Oaxaca, MX, from near sea level up to nearly 3000m.  They utilize a wide variety of habitat, including grassland, subalpine forest, woodland, semidesert scrub, rocky slopes, cliffs, canyons and streambeds.  They are primarily nocturnal in habit, often crepuscular on cloudy days and reputed to be more active during day after heavy rainfall.  Rodents and other small mammals form the bulk of their diet, but small birds and lizards are also consumed.

Dangerously venomous, *C. molossus* should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

The dorsal color of *C. molossus* is variable and ranges from straw yellow to tan, yellow grey, greenish-grey, olive, or brown, and usually darkens posteriorly.  The dorsum is patterned anteriorly with dark irregular, rhombic, or diamond-shaped blotches which are often outlined with a row of lighter colored scales.  Posteriorly, these [dark blotches fade in color, and usually merge with darker colored patches laterally to become bands](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/83272078?size=large), especially in northern populations.  These dark blotches/bands have a patch of light-colored scales in the center, which may be [reduced or absent](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/30290921?size=large) in southern populations.  A dark band or crown is usually present on top of the head [in between the eyes and extending to the snout](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/161698880?size=large), and a [dark postocular stripe](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/95486476?size=large) usually terminates at or before the corner of the mouth.  These head markings are occasionally reduced, especially in [southern populations](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/8161805?size=large).  The tail is dark, sometimes [completely black or nearly so](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/5052461?size=large), inspiring the common name.
