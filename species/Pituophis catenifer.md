Bullsnakes / Gophersnakes *Pituophis catenifer* are large (record 274.3 cm) actively foraging snakes with keeled scales found in a variety of habitats including disturbed areas like suburban yards. They are commonly encountered snakes throughout western North America and make good pest control as they eat primarily small mammals.

*Pituophis* pine and bull snakes may puff up or flatten out defensively, but are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom. They are known for a terrific hissing display when threatened - aided by a [epiglottal keel](https://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/new/MartinHuey71Copeia.pdf). They are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods.
