Central American Milksnakes *Lampropeltis abnorma* are medium-sized non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of seven species of milk and kingsnakes called the triangulum species complex. Central American Milksnakes are found in central America from Mexico to western Costa Rica. They kill by overpowering their prey and will eat mainly rodents, but are generalists and consume lizards, birds, eggs and invertebrates. These milksnakes are variable in color - geographic range helps greatly in identification and to distinguish them from other species.

This recent multi-locus work is well done, published in a high-tier journal and was well-received by those who understand the coalescent. It's supported by morphological work (Link 2) and has been adopted by the major North American herp societies.
