Western Ribbonsnakes *Thamnophis proximus* are medium sized (51-76cm, record 126.8 cm), slender, New World natricine snakes that range across much of the central US, south through Mexico into Costa Rica.
They utilize a wide variety of habitats, but typically stay close to some source of freshwater, where they can find their main prey, frogs and tadpoles. Salamanders, fish, and small lizards are occasionally taken.

When cornered/frightened, *T. proximus*, like many garter and water snakes, might flatten the head and body to make itself appear larger, bite or pretend to bite, and release a foul smelling musk from the vent. Mild toxins in the saliva may be effective at subduing smaller prey items, but bites are considered harmless to humans.

*T. proximus* can be differentiated from sympatric garter snakes by the combination of the following characteristics; a proportionally slender body and head, proportionally large eyes, unmarked, light colored labial scales, lateral stripes positioned on scale rows 3 & 4, and a small preocular light marking that contrasts with the darker coloration of the head.  The presence of 8 supralabials (upper lip scales), larger, prominent, fused parietal spots, and the absence of ventrolateral stripes help differentiate it from the eastern ribbonsnake, *T. saurita*, whose range they overlap slightly in the east.
