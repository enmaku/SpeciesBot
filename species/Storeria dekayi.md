Brownsnakes *Storeria dekayi* are small (20.0-40.0cm record 52.77cm) natricine snakes often found in disturbed habitats like urban and suburban yards. They are one of the most commonly encountered snakes in eastern North America and make good pest control as they feast on small, soft-bodied invertebrates. 

A separate but distinct species, *Storeria victa* occupies peninsular Florida. It has two fewer midbody scales (15) than *Storeria dekayi* and is more likely to have yellow collar markings on the neck.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom and are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.
