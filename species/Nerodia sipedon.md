Common Watersnakes *Nerodia sipedon* are medium (record 150 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found near water in large numbers. They are commonly encountered fish eating snakes across much of eastern North America.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

A very wide ranging snake in North America, it is replaced in the extreme south by, and likely exchanges genes with, the Banded Watersnake *Nerodia fasciata*. Banded Watersnakes have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In common watersnakes *N. sipedon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body.

This genus, as well as this species specifically, are in need of revision using modern molecular methods.
