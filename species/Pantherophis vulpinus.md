Eastern Foxsnakes *Pantherophis vulpinus* are large (91-137cm, record 179cm), harmless ratsnakes native to the US Midwestern states east of the Mississippi River, and southern Ontario in Canada. Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).

*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.

A closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.
