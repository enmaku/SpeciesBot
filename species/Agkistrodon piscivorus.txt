Northern Cottonmouths *Agkistrodon piscivorus* are one of two recognized species of large (76-114 cm record 188 cm) semi-aquatic pitvipers in eastern North America. Florida has a closely related but distinct species, the Florida cottonmouth *Agkistrodon conanti.* 

Cottonmouths are venomous, and are therefore dangerous if approached closely or handled. They are not generally aggressive and will most likely flee any confrontation if given a chance to retreat. Some may bluff charge or boldly move towards humans to get out of a cornered situation, but have never been recorded chasing people.
 
Northern Cottonmouths are dark, possibly [faintly patterned snakes](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qC4kTiy8JRQ/maxresdefault.jpg) (except as juveniles), best known for their defensive posture with a gaping, white lined mouth. They are also distinguishable from most watersnakes by their sharp brow ridges and dark stripe over the eyes.
 
The specific epithet "piscivorus" describes the one of the prey species of the cottonmouth - fish. The cottonmouth is also fond of frogs, mammals and other snakes. Although it may be commonly seen in lakes and ponds frequented by humans, few fatalities are recorded as a result of bites by cottonmouths.

The *Agkistrodon piscivorus* species complex has been delimited using modern molecular methods and two species with no subspecies are recognized. There is a zone of admixture between the two cottonmouth species where they overlap around panhandle Florida.
