Western Foxsnakes *Pantherophis ramspotti* are medium-large (91-137cm, record 155cm) harmless ratsnakes native to the US Midwestern states, west of the Mississippi River. Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs.

Western foxsnakes are habitat generalists and utilize prairie, meadows, marshes, agricultural land, valleys, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland.  Grassy areas are favored.

A closely related and morphological similar species, the Eastern Foxsnake *Pantherophis vulpinus*, ranges east of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along both sides of the river.
