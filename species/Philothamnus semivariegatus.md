Spotted Bush Snakes *Philothamnus semivariegatus* are medium sized (70-110cm, up to 141cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from the western coast of Senegal east to extreme western Somalia, south along both coasts through to the southern coast of South Africa, with isolated populations in Eritrea and Mali, from near sea level up to 2,000m.
  
Primarily diurnal in habit, *P. semivariegatus* are semiarboreal and spend much of their time in shrubs and trees where they hunt lizards and frogs.  They utilize a wide variety of habitat ranging from mesic to arid, including savanna, open woodland, thickets, forest edges and clearings, and semi-desert.  They can also often be found in disturbed or even urban areas, where they inhabit agricultural areas, parks, and gardens. 

Like some other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. semivariegatus* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the blue skin is between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Spotted Bush Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 9 (8-9) supralabials with 4-6 (occasionally 4 & 5) in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular, which is in contact with the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There are usually 2 anterior temporal scales and usually 2 posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventral and subcaudals are laterally keeled.
