Shire Slug-Eaters *Duberria shirana* are small (20-30cm, up to 32cm), harmless pseudoxyrhophiid snakes that range from north-central Democratic Republic of the Congo east to southwestern Uganda, south and east into central Tanzania and northwestern Mozambique, from 1,249 to 2,000m above sea level.  They primarily inhabit moist microhabitats within grassland, forest, and wetland fringes in montane areas.

Primarily diurnal in habit, *D. shirana* prey almost exclusively on slugs and snails, providing a valuable service to farmers and gardeners.  When threatened, these small and inoffensive snakes rarely bite, but writhe around and emit an unpleasant smelling musk.

Shire Slug-Eaters have smooth dorsal scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is small, indistinct at the neck, and with a short muzzle.  There are 6 supralabials with the 3rd and 4th in contact with the eye, 1 preocular, and 1 postocular.  Unlike several close relatives, the loreal scale is absent.  The tail is short and ends in a sharp tip.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are paired.
