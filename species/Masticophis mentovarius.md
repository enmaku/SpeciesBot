Neotropical Whipsnakes *Masticophis mentovarius* are large (100-180cm, up to 253cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from Sonora, MX south through Central America and into Columbia and northwestern Venezuela, from sea level up to 2,170m.  They utilize a wide variety of open habitat, including scrubland, forest clearings and edges, open woodland, savanna, and beaches.

Diurnal in habit, *M. mentovarius* are swift-moving snakes and are often observed actively foraging for prey with the head and forebody elevated to increase their range of vision.  Their diet is varied and consists of lizards, rodents and other small mammals, snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), frogs, small birds, and insects.

Neotropical Whipsnakes are long and slender to moderately built, with an elongate head and large eyes.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 17 rows across at midbody.  The dorsal coloration is tan, brown, or grey-brown, sometimes patterned with dark lines, spots, or stippling, and/or light colored lateral stripes which are most visible on the neck, but become obscure posteriorly.  The underside of the tail is usually pinkish, and the anal scale is divided.
