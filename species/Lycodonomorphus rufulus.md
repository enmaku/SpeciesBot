Common Brown Water Snakes *Lycodonomorphus rufulus* are medium sized (50-60cm, up to 97cm), harmless lamprophiid snakes that range from central Zimbabwe and adjacent Mozambique south through eastern and southern South Africa, from 365-2,135m above sea level.  They primarily inhabit the perimeters of wetlands and bodies of water within savanna, woodland, grassland, and scrub.  They can be common in disturbed areas, such as dams, and residential yards and gardens that are adjacent to a water source.

Primarily nocturnal in habit, *L. rufulus* might also be active during the day, especially in shaded areas near water. Semiaquatic, they are powerful constrictors and mainly consume prey such as frogs, tadpoles, and fish.  Small rodents, lizards, and snakes are also taken.

Common Brown Water Snakes have smooth dorsal scales arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  The head is fairly small, and the eyes are moderate in size.  There are usually 8 supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, 1 preocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are paired.
