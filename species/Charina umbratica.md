Southern Rubber Boas *Charina umbratica* are small (<60cm record 83.8 cm), variable olive brown to pinkish boas with a light cream to yellow belly. Males have small visible spurs. 

Southern Rubber Boas are found only in a small part of Southern California. There are two  currently recognized species of rubber boa, Northern Rubber Boa *Charina bottae* and Southern Rubber Boa *Charina umbratica* [Range Map in CA](https://imgur.com/BsrXq50.jpg). There are also two species of "rosy boa", the Rosy Boa *Lichanura orcutti* and the Three-lined Boa *Lichanura trivirgata*. [Range Map] ( https://imgur.com/Ouugbix.jpg).

Rubber boas are fossorial to semi-fossorial, and spend much of their time underground. They prefer cool, moist habitats, and are not very tolerant of heat.

They are typically very gentle, docile snakes that rarely bite while being handled. Their primary defense is a tail which mimics their head, and if threatened, they will coil up and raise their tail. Because of this, many wild caught specimens will have significant scarring on their tail.

Rubber boas belong to the Erycinae subfamily of boas and are closely related to *Lichanura* Rosy Boas and more distantly, *Eryx* Sand Boas.
