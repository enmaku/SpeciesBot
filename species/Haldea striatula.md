Rough Earthsnakes *Haldea striatula* are small (record 39.3 cm) natricine snakes found in eastern North America that feed on primarily earthworms.
 
Rough earthsnakes are considered harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. They have keeled scales, a cone-shaped head and pointed snout. The internasal scales that are generally paired in other snakes are fused.

*Haldea striatula* is live bearing, having as many as 7  small (7.5-12.5 cm) young in the late summer. Neonates somewhat resemble ringneck snakes with a light colored neck collar, but lose this trait as they become adults.
