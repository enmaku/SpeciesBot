Mole Snakes *Pseudaspis cana* are large (100-160cm, up to 210cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from southwestern Kenya in the east and central Angola in the west, south to the southern shore of South Africa, from sea level to 2,600m.  They chiefly occupy savanna and grassland, especially with loose soil.

Primarily diurnal and semifossorial in habit, *P. cana* spend much of their time underground, patrolling for prey in mammal burrows, or near the surface under loose sand.  They are powerful constrictors and prey heavily on small mammals, especially mole rats and other rodents.  Lizards, birds, and bird eggs are also taken.  They are often conspicuous and easily observed when above ground, but if approached too closely, [they often rear up and hiss loudly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hijMydjpSgQ).  If approached or harassed further, they make lunging strikes.  Though they are not venomous, bites can cause painful lacerations which sometimes require stitches to close, and should be washed with mild soap and warm water or other gentle disinfectant.

Mole Snakes have smooth or weakly keeled dorsal scales that are arranged in 25-31 rows at midbody.  The body is fairly robust, especially in larger adults.  The head is proportionally small and indistinct at the neck, with a pronounced snout which is usually pointed.  There are usually 7 supralabials with the 4th in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, usually 1 preocular, and 2-3 postoculars.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.
