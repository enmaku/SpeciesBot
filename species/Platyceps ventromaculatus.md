Glossy-bellied Racers *Platyceps ventromaculatus* are medium sized (74-91cm, up to 126cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from northern and southwestern Pakistan south and east into north-central and west-central India, from sea level to 500m; usually below 200m.  They occupy mostly dry areas with rocky or sandy soils, including semi-desert grassland, scrubby slopes, open desert, woodland, and farmland.  In some parts of their range (e.g. New Delhi), they even penetrate urban areas, and are known to enter buildings in search of lizards and mice.

*P. ventromaculatus* are morphologically and ecologically similar to *P. karelini* and replace that species to the east.  They are largely crepuscular in habit, but might sometimes be active late at night or midday.  They are active, swift-moving, and vision oriented hunters whose main prey is lizards and small mammals, but frogs, small birds, and insects are also sometimes taken.

Glossy-bellied Racers have smooth scales arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  The head is moderate in size and the eyes are large.  There are usually 9 supralabials, usually with the 5th and 6th in contact with the eye, along with a loreal scale, one large preocular, a small presubocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
