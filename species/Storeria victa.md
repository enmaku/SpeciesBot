Florida Brownsnakes *Storeria victa* are small (17.7-25.4 cm, record 48.26 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in disturbed habitats like urban and suburban yards. They are commonly encountered snakes in Florida and make good pest control as they feast on small, soft-bodied invertebrates.

A separate but distinct species, *Storeria dekayi* occupies eastern continental North America. It has two more midbody scale rows (17) than *Storeria victa*.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes may puff up or flatten out defensively, but are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom. They are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.
