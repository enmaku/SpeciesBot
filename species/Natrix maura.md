Viperine Snakes *Natrix maura* are medium sized (45-80cm, up to 100cm), Old World natricine snakes that range from northeastern France southeast into northwestern Italy and Sardinia, and southwest through Iberia, into northern Africa from the Atlantic Coast of Morocco east into northwestern Libya; up to 2,600m above sea level in Morocco.  Semi-aquatic in habit, they rarely stray far from well-vegetated, aquatic surroundings, including ponds, lakes, sluggish rivers, marshes, canals, and will also utilize brackish habitat.

*N. maura* are mainly diurnal, but might become crepuscular in hot weather.  Prey is mostly fish, amphibians, and amphibian larvae, which are often ambushed underwater, but earthworms and slugs are occasionally taken.  When near water, they often dive to escape from humans and other predators.  They are not aggressive and rarely bite, but when threatened often flatten the head and/or body to appear larger, strike repeatedly (with the mouth usually closed), release a foul smelling musk from the vent, and/or dramatically play dead.

Viperine Snakes have keeled scales, usually arranged in 21 rows at midbody.  The eyes are positioned somewhat dorsally.  They usually have 7 supralabials with the 3rd and 4th in contact with the eye, usually 2 (1-2) preoculars, and usually 2 (2-3) postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.  They are often confused with closely related species; *N. helvetica* and *N. astreptophora* can be differentiated by having having more laterally positioned eyes and usually only 19 dorsal scale rows at midbody.  *N. tessellata* can be differentiated by usually having 8 supralabials, usually 19 dorsal scale rows at midbody, and usually 3-4 postocular scales.

*N. maura* are also commonly confused with the venomous asp viper, *Vipera aspis*, but *V. aspis* has 1. [numerous small scales instead of large plates on top of the head](https://snakeevolution.org/images/Vparietals.png), 2. [a large supraocular scale that forms a brow, imparting a "grumpy" appearance](https://snakeevolution.org/images/Vsupraoc.png), and 3. [a slightly upturned snout which forms a ridge with adjacent scales](https://snakeevolution.org/images/Vsnout.png). Other vipers can have larger scales on top of the head than *V. aspis*, but [1. still conspicuously smaller and more numerous than *N. maura*](https://snakeevolution.org/images/VberNmaupar.png), and [2. still have a raised supraocular "brow" somewhat like *V. aspis*](https://snakeevolution.org/images/VberNmausupocu.png).
