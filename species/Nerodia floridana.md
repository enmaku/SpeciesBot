Florida Green Watersnakes *Nerodia floridana* are medium-large (76-140cm, record 188cm), robustly built, New World natricine snakes that range from southern Georgia south through Florida and west to extreme SE Alabama, with a disjunct population in southern South Carolina and extreme east-central Georgia.  They chiefly inhabit open, well vegetated wetlands and calm bodies of water, including marshes, flooded prairie, rice paddies, overgrown ditches, verdant lakes and ponds, and will also utilize brackish water.

Like other *Nerodia* watersnakes, *N. floridana* often puff up or flatten their bodies when they feel threatened.  When seized, they often secrete a foul smelling musk from the cloaca and may also bite.  Mild anticoagulant toxins in the saliva might be effective for handling their main prey, fish and frogs, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need mild soap and water, or some hand sanitizer.

*N. floridana* have strongly keeled scales arranged in 27-29 rows at midbody.  The eyes are positioned somewhat dorsally (toward the top of the head, rather than the side), and there is a row of small subocular scales separating the supralabials (upper lip scales) from the eye.  The anal scale is divided.  The belly is light colored with some dark markings near the tail.They are sometimes confused with other *Nerodia* watersnakes, as well as venomous *Agkistrodon* cottonmouths.  Some characteristics for differentiating these snakes include;
* venomous *Agkistrodon* cottonmouths, have larger, chunkier heads with proportionally smaller eyes, and a prominent, angular, facial ridge ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)) which protrudes over the eye like a brow, and gives the snake a [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039) and partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/).

* *N. erythrogaster*, *N. fasciata*, *N. clarkii*, and *N. sipedon* usually have 21-23 dorsal scale rows at midbody, more laterally positioned eyes, and lack subocular scales
* *N. taxispilota* lack subocular scales, and have smaller, fragmented parietal and temporal scales
* *N. cyclopion* has a dark belly with light markings, and often frequents darker, shaded areas such as swamps and other forested wetlands
