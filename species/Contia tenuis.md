Sharp-tailed Snakes *Contia tenuis* are small (<30cm, record 48.3cm) dipsadine snakes that range from British Columbia south through Washington to California, with a spotty distribution across the northern extent.  Contia have smooth scales and inhabit moist areas within woodland, grassy or scrubby areas, suburban backyards and gardens.  Secretive and typically found under surface cover during the cooler parts of spring and autumn, these fossorial snakes withdraw underground during dry spells, turning up in rural and suburban dwellings with some regularity.  Diet consists of slugs and their eggs, and dentition is specialized with long, recurve teeth common in "goo-eaters" and other slimy prey specialists.

Sharp-tailed Snakes rarely bite and are considered harmless to humans.  When frightened or handled they may ball up with the head hidden in the center, poke the handler with the sharp tip of the tail, defecate and release a musk intended to deter predators.  

A closely related species, the Forest Sharp-tailed Snake *C. longicauda* is morphologically similar and best differentiated by range.  Where both ranges overlap in northern CA and southern OR, *C. tenuis* can be differentiated by their lower number of caudal scales (24-42, vs 43-58 in *C. longicauda*) and shorter tail (~15% of total length, vs ~20%).
