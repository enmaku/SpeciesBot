Peringuey's Adders, *Bitis peringueyi* are small (20-25cm, up to 33cm) true vipers that range from southwestern Angola south into southwestern Namibia, from near sea level up to 1,500m in the the Namib Desert.  Their primary mode of locomotion is side-winding ([see video demonstration here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSfiZfGAGro)), which allows them to ascend steep dunes with loose sand, and also helps prevent overheating by keeping part of the body off of the hot sand while they move.  Active by day or night, they are well adapted to their desert environment, where they typically bury themselves under the sand with only the top of the head exposed ([see video demonstration here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014ux9KAmCw)) and ambush lizard prey.

Generally not considered deadly, *B. peringueyi* are nonetheless dangerously venomous and should only be observed from a distance.  When frightened, individuals might hiss loudly, writhe from side to side, and/or vigorously strike toward the perceived aggressor.  Attempting to kill or capture the snake dramatically increases the risk of being bitten.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Peringuey's Adders are small but stout bodied, with proportionally large and distinct heads and very dorsally positioned eyes.  The head and body are vertically flattened.  The dorsal scales are strongly keeled and arranged in 22-27 rows at midbody.  The head is covered by a large number of small, mostly keeled scales.  There are usually 15-17 supralabials, which are separated from the eye by 2-4 rows of smaller scales.  The anal scale is single, but the subcaudals are divided.
