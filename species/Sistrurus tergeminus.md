Western Massasaugas *Sistrurus tergeminus* are small-medium (47-76cm, up to 88.3cm), pit vipers with a highly fragmented range, from southeastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, and north-central Missouri south and west into south Texas, southeastern Arizona, with small, isolated populations in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila.  They chiefly inhabit prairie, scrubland, semi-desert grassland, rock strewn slopes, and coastal dune systems, especially near water.  Until fairly recently, *S. tergeminus* were considered a population of the massasauga *S. catenatus*.

Dangerously venomous, *S. tergeminus* should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, and may slowly attempt to crawl away while still facing their perceived attacker.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Largely crepuscular in habit, *S. tergeminus* may become nocturnal during the hotter summer months.  They prey primarily on lizards and small mammals, but centipedes, snakes, amphibians, and small birds are also taken.

The pygmy rattlesnake *S. miliarius* can be distinguished from *S. tergeminus* by having a proportionally tiny rattle, and by usually having an orange or reddish middorsal stripe.
