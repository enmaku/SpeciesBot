Dahl's Whipsnakes *Platyceps najadum* are slender, medium sized (>100cm, but up to 140cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from the Mediterranean coast of Croatia south through the Balkan peninsula and Turkey into coastal Lebanon, east to central Iran and back north through the Caucasus into extreme southern Russia, with a disjunct population in south-central Turkmenistan, from sea level to over 2100m. 

*P. najadum* inhabit dry, rocky areas with brushy vegetation, including forest clearings, hillsides, valleys, meadow, steppe, and rock outcrops.  They can also be common near areas of human habitation, where they inhabit unoccupied gardens, farmland, old ruins, and rock walls overgrown with brush.  Diurnal in habit, they are active, swift-moving, and vision oriented hunters.  Their main prey is lizards, but insects, rodents, and other reptiles are taken occasionally.

Dahl's Whipsnakes have smooth scales arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  The head is moderate in size and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 8 supralabials, usually with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, along with one large preocular, a small presubocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
