Eastern Ratsnakes *Pantherophis quadrivittatus* are large (record 256.5 cm) common harmless ratsnakes with a multitude of regional color patterns native to eastern North America. Eastern Ratsnakes are more likely to have a yellow base color and stripes. *Pantherophis* ratsnakes are keeled-scaled generalists that eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, and are particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.

Eastern Ratsnakes are currently recognized as distinct from Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis*, as well as Western Ratsnakes *P. obsoletus*. Parts of all three species were once generically labeled "black ratsnakes". Use the "!blackrat" command without the space for more on these changes.

Ratsnakes can be easily distinguished from racers *Coluber* by the presence of keeled scales. Racers have smooth scales.

*P. quadrivittatus* likely evolved in peninsular Florida and is tied to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, so coastal areas are home to *P. quadrivittatus* while Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis* occupy the higher elevations inland, up off the coastal plain. The two likely heavily exchange genes. 

Junior Synonyms and Common Names: Yellow Ratsnake, Everglades Ratsnake, Grey Ratsnake (in part), Black Ratsnake (in part), Greenish Ratsnake, Gulf Hammock Ratsnake, black snake, oak snake, chicken snake, rattlesnake pilot.
