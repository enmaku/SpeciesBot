Two-striped Gartersnakes *Thamnophis hammondii* are medium sized (61-76cm, record 102cm), New World natricine snakes that range from California's Central Coast south to Baja California, MX.  Favored habitat includes a wide variety of water bodies and wetlands (especially rocky ones) within wooded, scrubby, or grassy areas.  Their main prey is fish and amphibians, but fish eggs, leeches, and earthworms are sometimes taken.

When cornered/frightened, *T. hammondii*, like many garter and water snakes, may flatten the head and body to make itself appear larger, bite or pretend to bite, and release a foul smelling musk from the vent. Mild toxins in the saliva might be effective in subduing smaller prey items, but bites are considered harmless to humans.

The absence of a dorsal stripe beyond the neck differentiates *T. hammondii* from all sympatric garter snakes except *T. couchii*, with which they are sympatric in the Tehachapi Mountains.  They reportedly hybridize with *T. couchii* in this area, and with *T. atratus* in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, where the latter is apparently rare.  They are best differentiated from *T. couchii* [by a combination of scalation characteristics](http://www.californiaherps.com/identification/snakesid/gartersnakeskey.html).  Melanistic individuals are reportedly common in some areas.
