Striped Racers *Masticophis lateralis* are medium-large (76-122cm, up to 152cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from northern California south into southern Baja California, MX, from near sea level up to 2,250m.  They utilize a wide variety of open habit, especially chaparral and other scrubland, but also grassland, rocky slopes, riparian corridors, valleys, and mixed pine-deciduous montane woodland.  They are replaced at the southern tip of Baja California Sur, MX by the closely related Baja California striped whipsnake, *M. aurigulus*.

Diurnal in habit, *M. lateralis* are swift-moving snakes and often observed actively foraging for prey with the head and forebody elevated to increase their range of vision.  They also readily ascend bushes and trees to find prey or evade predators.  Their favorite prey is lizards, but rodents, snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), frogs, small birds, and insects are also frequently consumed.

Long and slender in form, *M. lateralis* have a somewhat elongate head and large eyes.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 17 rows across at midbody.  The dorsal coloration is black or a dark shade of brown, olive, or grey.  A [pair of light colored lateral stripes](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/158303202?size=large) are positioned on scale rows 3 & 4 [(and sometimes 5 in the East Bay area)](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/1049672?size=large).  The underside of the tail is [pinkish in coloration](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/35379504?size=large) and the anal scale is divided.

Striped Racers are sometimes confused with *Thamnophis* gartersnakes.  The latter differ by having strongly keeled scales, an undivided anal scale, and where they overlap with striped racers, by having 19 or 21 dorsal scale rows at midbody, and having their lateral stripes (when present) positioned on scale rows 2 & 3.  Striped racers are also sometimes confused with the closely related striped whipsnake *M. taeniatus*, but these do not overlap in range, have only 15 dorsal scale rows at midbody, and have a different striping pattern.  Desert patchnose snakes *Salvadora hexalepis* might also be confused occasionally, but they have a distinctively enlarged, triangular rostral scale and a prominent middorsal stripe which *M. lateralis* lacks.
