Olive House Snakes *Boaedon olivaceus* are medium sized (40-70cm, up to 90cm), harmless lamprophiid snakes that range from coastal Guinea east to central Uganda, south into central Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Angola, from near sea level to over 2,000m.  They principally inhabit forest and mixed savanna forest, but can be particularly common in disturbed areas, even in urban zones, where they occupy recently cleared forest, agricultural areas, parks, and gardens.

Populations from northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are now referred to Radford's House Snake *B. radfordi*.  Those from neighboring Uganda and Burundi are still referred to *B. olivaceus*, but further study is needed to determine the identity of those populations.  Primarily nocturnal in habit, they are powerful constrictors and prey primarily on rodents, shrews, and nestling birds.  Lizards and frogs are also taken.  They are often found near homes and buildings, a habit from whence they derive the common name "house snake".

Olive House Snakes have smooth, glossy dorsal scales arranged in 25-29 rows at midbody.  The head is slightly distinct at the neck, and the eyes are orange in color with vertical pupils.  There are 8-9 supralabials with 3-5 in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal scale, usually 1 (1-2) preocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale and the subcaudals are single.
