Rough Greensnakes *Opheodrys aestivus* are medium sized (56-81cm, up to 116cm) harmless colubrid snakes that range from southern New Jersey west to eastern Kansas and the eastern Trans-Pecos region of Texas, south through Florida, and into Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, and possibly northern Veracruz, Mexico from near sea level up to 1,525m.  

Chiefly diurnal and semi-arboreal in habit, *O. aestivus* principally inhabit moist, well-vegetated areas along forest edges, scrub, and grassland especially alongside water bodies and wetlands.  They spend much of their time in trees and shrubs but often forage at the ground level or in low vegetation for their main prey, caterpillars, grasshoppers, crickets, other insects and spiders. 

Rough Greensnakes are [bright green above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bengenter/51526432619/), with a whitish, yellow, or greenish underside.  They are slender in build, with a long, narrow head and large eyes.  They have keeled dorsal scales which are arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The only similar species within its range are the Smooth Green Snake *O. vernalis* and some Racers *Coluber constrictor* which can be greenish, but those species both have smooth dorsal scales.  Due to the rapid decomposition of yellow pigment, *O. aestivus* slowly turn blue in coloration after death.

Opheodrys aestivus likely contains unrecognized diversity, with peninsular Florida harboring a unique lineage.
