The Yellow Garden Spider, Argiope aurantia, also known as the writing or zipper spider, is a common spider endemic to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. It has distinctive yellow and black markings on its abdomen and a mostly-white cephalothorax.

Argiope aurantia spins a distinctive web, large and circular in shape, with a dense zigzag of silk known as a stabilimentum in the center. The purpose of this structure is widely disputed - It may be camouflage for the spider, an attractant for insects, or may warn birds of the presence of a difficult-to-see web.

Argiope spiders are not aggressive or territorial, though they may bite if harassed. Like most spiders they are venomous but their venom is not medically significant in non-allergic individuals and usually produces slight pain and swelling similar to a bee sting.
