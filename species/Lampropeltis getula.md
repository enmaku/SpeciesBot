Eastern kingsnakes *Lampropeltis getula* are large (90-122 cm record 208.3 cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the getula species complex. Eastern Kingsnakes are found east of the Appalachian Mountains. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes are immune to the venom of the species on which they prey. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range.

Two additional species, subsets of the Eastern Kingsnake, [were recently identified](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/108/3/226/2948264) but the analysis did not include hypothesis testing or robust molecular methods. Recent work by the same authors [is dismissed](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/318766) for these same reasons so SEB does not yet recognize these as taxa.
