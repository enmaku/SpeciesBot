Coast Mountain Kingsnakes *Lampropeltis multifasciata* are medium (51-127cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes native to coastal mountain ranges of central and southern California into Baja California. Their close relative the California Mountain Kingsnake *L. zonata*, now considered a separate species, inhabits inland ranges as well as coastal ranges north of Monterey Bay.

Coast Mountain Kingsnakes are primarily diurnal but secretive. Typically found at higher elevations, they favor rocky areas which provide ample ground cover. They mainly prey on lizards and small mammals but may also eat small birds, amphibians, snakes, and eggs.

The dorsal pattern of *L. multifasciata* typically consists of red/orange, black, and white rings that circle the entire body. The dorsal scales are smooth and shiny. They and their close relative the California mountain Kingsnakes *L. zonata* can be differentiated from both sympatric California Kingsnake *L. californiae* as well as other Mountain Kingsnakes outside their range by the presence of a fully black snout.
