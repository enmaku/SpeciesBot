Roger's Racers *Platyceps rogersi* are medium sized (~80cm, up to 108cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from northwestern Libya east into southern Israel and central Jordan, north into southern Syria, from sea level to 1500m.  They primarily occupy dry areas with rocky soils, including steppe, semi-desert scrub, open desert, wadis, and can sometimes be found near ditches and canals.

*P. rogersi* are largely diurnal, but will switch to crepuscular or nocturnal activity during the hottest months.  They are active, swift-moving, and vision oriented hunters whose main prey is lizards and small mammals, but amphibians also sometimes taken.

*P. rogersi* have smooth scales arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  The head is moderate in size the eyes are large.  There are usually 9 supralabials (occasionally 8), usually with the 5th and 6th (occasionally 4th and 5th) in contact with the eye, along with a loreal scale, one large preocular, a small presubocular, sometimes a medial subocular (which separates 5th, occasionally 4th, supralabial from eye), and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
