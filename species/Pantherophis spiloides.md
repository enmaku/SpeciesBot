This is a legacy name and is no longer in use - Central Ratsnakes are now *Pantherophis alleghaniensis*. Eastern Ratsnakes, formerly *Pantherophis alleghaniensis*, are now *Pantherophis quadrivittatus*: See the !blackrat command for more.

Central Ratsnakes, formerly called *Pantherophis spiloides*, are large (record 256.5 cm) common harmless ratsnakes with a multitude of regional color patterns native to eastern and central North America between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River Embayment. *Pantherophis* ratsnakes are keeled-scaled generalists that eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, and are particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.
