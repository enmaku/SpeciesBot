Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnakes *Crotalus adamanteus* are large (76-183cm, record 233.7cm) stout-bodied rattlesnakes native to the coastal plains of the southeastern US from southeast North Carolina south through Florida, west to coastal Mississippi and extreme southeastern Louisiana.  They tend to inhabit areas with sandy or loamy soils and a brushy palmetto understory, including pine flatwoods, old field and other early successional habitat, hammocks, scrubland, coastal dunes, and barrier islands.  They are tolerant of saltwater and will sometimes take to sea to travel to and from suitable island habitat and around barrier islands.  They prey primarily on rodents and lagomorphs.

*C. adamanteus* are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

*Crotalus adamanteus* are unlikely to be confused with other rattlesnakes.  The only other large rattlesnake that overlaps in range is the timber rattlesnake, *C. horridus*, from which *C. adamanteus* is easily differentiated by a pair of [light colored, diagonal lines that run from the eye toward the cheek](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/29820667?size=large), diamond-shaped dorsal blotches, and their different habitat preferences.
