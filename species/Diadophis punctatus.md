Ring-necked Snakes *Diadophis punctatus* are a group of small (< 50 cm, record 85.7cm in a western specimen) dipsadine snakes with smooth scales native to North America as far south as San Luis Petosi. They feed primarily on soft-bodied amphibians and their eggs. Diet is location specific, with some populations specializing in squamate prey. Ring-necked snakes possess a mild venom that is delivered via specialized rear fangs. This venom is used for prey handling and is not considered medically significant to humans. While Ring-necked Snakes rarely bite in self defense, they may musk, coil the bright underside of the tail tightly in a flash or misdirection display and occasionally play dead.

*Diadophis punctatus*, while currently described as a single species, likely harbors cryptic diversity. Like many other snakes, subspecies designations are based on morphology and don't track well with evolutionary history of the group. Fontanella et al investigated *Diadophis* using a mtDNA dataset, revealing  structure that seemingly corresponds to populations expanding out of southern glacial refugia after the last "Ice Age" (Pleistocene). This complex is in need of revision using modern methods and samples from populations in Mexico.
