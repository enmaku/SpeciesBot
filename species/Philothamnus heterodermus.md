Emerald Green Snakes *Philothamnus heterodermus* are medium sized (45-70cm, up to 90cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from the southern coast of Senegal east into the Central African Republic, and south into far northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo and coastal Equatorial Guinea, from near sea level up to 1,400m.  They chiefly inhabit well vegetated areas, including dense forest, forest clearings and edges, and savanna, especially near water, and can sometimes be common around areas of human habitation.
  
Diurnal and semiarboreal in habit, *P. heterodermus* are as comfortable in trees and shrubbery as they are on the ground.  Like their closest relatives, they are believed to prey primarily on frogs and occasionally lizards.

Like many other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. heterodermus* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Emerald Green Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 13-15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 9 (8-9) supralabials with 4-6 in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which does not contact the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There are 2 anterior and 2 posterior temporal scales.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals are laterally keeled, but the subcaudals are smooth.
