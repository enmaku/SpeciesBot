Variegated Slug-Eaters *Duberria variegata* are small (25-35cm, up to 40cm) harmless pseudoxyrhophiid snakes with a limited range in extreme southeastern Mozambique and the northeastern part of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa from near sea level to 50m.  They primarily inhabit vegetated dunes and coastal lowland forest.

Active by day or night, *D. variegata* prey almost exclusively on slugs and snails.  When threatened, these small and inoffensive snakes rarely bite, but writhe around and emit an unpleasant smelling musk.

Variegated Slug-Eaters have smooth dorsal scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is small, indistinct at the neck, and with a short muzzle.  There are 6-7 supralabials with 3 & 4 or 4 & 5 in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, 1 preocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are paired.
