Green Water Snakes, or Southeastern Green Snakes, *Philothamnus hoplogaster* are medium sized (40-70cm, up to 96cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from extreme southwestern Congo-Brazzaville east to southeastern Kenya, south to southern South Africa and northern Angola, with isolated populations around Lake Victoria in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, and possibly also in South Sudan, from near sea level up to 1,800m.  They principally inhabit wet, well vegetated areas, including marshland, riparian ecotone, and wetlands and water bodies within moist savanna and forest.  They can be common in and around areas of human habitation, especially near water.  

Primarily diurnal in habit, *P. hoplogaster* are both semiaquatic and semiarboreal, spending time in water as well in shrubs and trees near the water.  Their main prey is frogs, but fish, lizards, and insects are also taken to varying degrees.

*P. hoplogaster* are sometimes confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but these grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Green Water Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, not as elongate as most other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, and with moderately large eyes.  There are 8 supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, 1 preocular which is not in contact with the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There is 1 anterior temporal scale and usually 1 (1-2) posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  A ventral keel is occasionally present, but there is no subcaudal keel.
