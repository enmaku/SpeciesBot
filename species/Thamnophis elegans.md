Western Terrestrial Gartersnakes *Thamnophis elegans* are medium sized (46-76cm, record 109cm) New World natricine snakes that range across much of southwestern Canada and the western United States, with a disjunct population in Baja California, Mexico.  Scales are strongly keeled and the anal plate is undivided.  
 
*T. elegans* is found in a wide variety of habitats, from grasslands to scrub to woodlands; usually close to water, but will travel long distances away.  One of the most terrestrial garter snakes, and one of the least likely to seek refuge in water if approached or otherwise threatened, they are generalist predators with a remarkably wide range of recorded prey items, including amphibians, earthworms, leeches, slugs, fish, lizards, small snakes, small birds, small rodents and bats.
 
When cornered or frightened the Western Terrestrial Gartersnake, like many garter and water snakes, might flatten the head and body to make itself appear larger, bite or pretend to bite, and release a foul smelling musk from the vent.  Mild toxins in the saliva are effective in subduing prey, but bites are considered harmless to humans.
 
This species shares its very wide range with a large number of other gartersnake species.  Differentiating from other garters can be difficult, and in a few locations sometimes requires close inspection by an experienced person.  Western Terrestrial Gartersnakes, however, typically have;
• 8 upper labial scales
• 10 lower labial scales
• internasal scales wider than they are long
• anterior and posterior chin shields of equal length
• well defined, but dull colored, dorsal stripe which runs the length of the snake
• proportionally large head and small eyes relative to some other sympatric species

This genus and this species are in need of revision using modern molecular methods.
