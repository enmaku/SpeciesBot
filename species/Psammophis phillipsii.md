West African Olive Grass Snakes *Psammophis phillipsii* are large (100-150cm, up to 181cm), mildly venomous, psammophiid snakes that range from the southwestern coast of Senegal south and east to southern Nigeria and extreme northwestern Cameroon, from to sea level to 1,200m.  They primarily inhabit moist lowland within a wide variety of broader ecotypes, including savanna, forest clearings, and open woodland, but will also utilize disturbed areas such as agricultural plantations and gardens.

Rear-fanged snakes, *P. phillipsii* are mildly venomous, but generally considered harmless to humans.  Envenomation is uncommon and usually mild, but prolonged, chewing bites should be avoided as a precaution.  They are extraordinarily wary, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and harassed**.  Diurnal in habit, these active, swift moving, and vision-oriented hunters prey primarily on lizards.  Snakes, rodents, and insects are also consumed.

West African Olive Grass Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 8 supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal, a preocular, and usually 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is usually single.  They are closely related to the similar East African Olive Sand Snake *P. mossambicus*, which replaces them to the east and south.
