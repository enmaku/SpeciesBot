Forskål's Sandsnakes *Psammophis schokari* are medium-large (100-120cm, up to 148cm), mildly venomous, psammophiid snakes that range from the Atlantic Coasts of Morocco and Mauritania east into northern Pakistan and extreme eastern India, and north as far as south-central Turkmenistan, from sea level to 2,400m.  They inhabit a wide variety of arid and semiarid areas, sometimes near water, including Mediterranean scrub, dry grassland, open desert, rocky slopes, wadis, oases, and agricultural areas.

*P. schokari* are mildly venomous, rear-fanged snakes; envenomation is uncommon and usually mild, but prolonged, chewing bites should be avoided as a precaution.  They are extraordinarily wary, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and harassed**.  Diurnal in habit, these active, swift moving, and vision-oriented hunters prey primarily on lizards, but snakes, rodents, and small birds are also taken.

Forskål's Sandsnakes have smooth scales arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 9 supralabials, an elongate loreal, a preocular, and usually 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
