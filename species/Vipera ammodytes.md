Nose-horned Vipers *Vipera ammodytes* are medium sized (50-70cm, up to 110cm) true vipers that range from northeastern Italy east to extreme south-central Ukraine, south through the Balkan peninsula, with some small, disjunct populations in Asiatic Turkey, and many islands in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, from sea level to 2,500m. 

*V. ammodytes* are principally found in dry, stony areas, including Mediterranean scrub, slopes, open forest, forest edges, and the perimeters of lakes and streams.  They will also utilize areas disturbed by humans, including rock walls, hedgerows, and disused gardens.  They are mostly diurnal, but become crepuscular or nocturnal during hot weather.  Prey is mostly rodents and other small mammals, but lizards, snakes, and birds are also taken.

Nose-horned Vipers are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Slow moving, shy, and retiring, they are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

*V. ammodytes* have keeled dorsal scales arranged in 21-23 rows at midbody.  The supraocular scale is raised and juts over the eye like a brow, imparting a "grumpy" appearance.  A prominent horn-like structure at the tip of the snout reliably differentiates them from every other snake within their range.  The closely related Transcaucasian viper *V. transcaucasiana* has a similar horn and dorsal pattern, and replaces *V. ammodytes* in Turkey from Kocaeli Province and eastward.
