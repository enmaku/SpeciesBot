Smooth Earthsnakes *Virginia valeriae* are small (18-25cm, record 39.3 cm), North American natricine snakes that range through much of the eastern US, from New Jersey west to central Iowa, south to central Texas and south-central Florida.  Semi-fossorial in habit, their diet consists largely of earthworms; slugs, snails, and soft-bodied insects are also taken.
  
Smooth Earthsnakes are harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. Scales are smooth or weakly keeled, which helps differentiate it from Rough Earthsnakes, *Haldea striatula*, and Brownsnakes, *Storeria* spp., that overlap much of its range.  A less cone-shaped head, presence of two internasal scales, two preocular scales, and six supralabials further differentiates it from the Rough Earthsnake *Haldea striatula*.
  
*Virginia valeriae* is live bearing, having as many as 18 small (8-11.5 cm) young in the late summer. Neonates are grayish or brownish in color, mostly unpatterned, and look more or less like miniature adults.
