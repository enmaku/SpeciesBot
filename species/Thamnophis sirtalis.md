Common Gartersnakes *Thamnophis sirtalis* are small (<90 cm, record 137.2 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in disturbed habitats like urban and suburban yards. They are commonly encountered generalist snakes across much of the North American continent and eat small invertebrates, fish, amphibians and mammals.
Western populations are a model organism for an elegant case study in evolutionary arms races, [Tetrodotoxin Resistance](http://snakesarelong.blogspot.com/2014/07/tetrodotoxin-resistant-snakes.html).

*Thamnophis* gartersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They can deliver a weak venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are [not considered medically significant to humans](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/).

One of the widest-ranging snakes in North America, this species complex is almost certainly harboring unrecognized diversity and shows strong population structure at major biogeographic barriers (ie Mississippi River embayment and Peninsular Florida).

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods.
