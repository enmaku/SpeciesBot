Irregular Bush Snakes *Philothamnus irregularis* are medium sized (up to 115cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from the southern coast of Senegal east into the Central African Republic, and south into far northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo and coastal Equatorial Guinea, from near sea level up to 1,400m.  They chiefly inhabit well vegetated areas within forest and savanna, especially near water, and can sometimes be common around areas of human habitation.
  
Diurnal and largely arboreal in habit, *P. irregularis* spend much of their time in trees and shrubs where they actively forage for frogs.  Lizards are also taken.  They are strong swimmers and can sometimes be found in water.

Unique among *Philothamnus* bush/green snakes, *P. irregularis* have a black lining inside the mouth, which they display as a warning when frightened.  Like many other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, however, they will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the black skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Irregular Bush Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are 9 supralabials with 4-6 in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which is in contact with the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There is 1 anterior temporal scale and 2 posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals are laterally keeled, but the subcaudals are smooth.
