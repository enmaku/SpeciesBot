Pinesnakes *Pituophis melanoleucus* are large (record 228.6 cm) secretive snakes with keeled scales found in sandy habitats. They are uncommon snakes found patchily in eastern North America and make good pest control as they eat primarily small mammals.

*Pituophis* pine and bull snakes may puff up or flatten out defensively, but are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom. They are known for a terrific hissing display when threatened - aided by a [epiglottal keel](https://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/new/MartinHuey71Copeia.pdf). They are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.
