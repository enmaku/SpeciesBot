Red Diamond Rattlesnakes *Crotalus ruber* are medium-large (76-137cm, up to 165cm), stout-bodied rattlesnakes that range from southwestern California south through Baja California, MX, including several islands, from sea level up to 2000m.  They typically inhabit desert, desert-scrub, scrubland, dune systems, and woodland, usually below 1,200m.  They are primarily nocturnal in habit, but often active by day during cooler weather.  Rodents and lagomorphs form the bulk of their diet, but lizards and small birds are also consumed.

Red Diamond Rattlesnakes are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Island populations of *C. ruber* attain smaller maximum sizes (<1m) than mainland populations do.  Many individuals on Isla San Lorenzo Sur have rattle deformities that lead to loss of the rattle entirely, reminiscent of the closely related and similar Santa Catalina rattlesnake *C. catalinensis*.

A dorsal pattern consisting of reddish-brown or pinkish-brown diamond-shaped blotches on a pink, brick red, reddish brown, or tan background differentiates *C. ruber* from all other rattlesnakes in most of it's range.  In the very small area where they overlap with their sister species group, the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake *C. atrox*, they can usually be differentiated by having a more reddish dorsal coloration and a less prominent peppering of black spots and/or speckles.
