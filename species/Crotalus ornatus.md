Eastern Black-Tailed Rattlesnakes *Crotalus ornatus* are medium-large (76-107cm, up to 132cm), stout-bodied rattlesnakes that range from north-central New Mexico east to central Texas, and south into Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon, MX from 500m to 2500m above sea level.  They favor habitat with abundant rock cover, including slopes, canyons, cliffs, montane woodland, streambeds, scrubland and desert.  Open desert and extensive flat areas are usually avoided.  They are primarily nocturnal in habit, often crepuscular on cloudy days and reputed to be more active during day after heavy rainfall.  Rodents form the bulk of their diet but small birds and lizards are also consumed.

Dangerously venomous, *C. ornatus* should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

The dorsal color of *C. ornatus* is highly variable and can range from cream to olive, greenish grey, [bluish grey](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/30291999?size=large), grey, [brownish grey](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/74721203?size=large), brown, yellow brown, tan, or [straw yellow](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/406552?size=large).  The dorsum is patterned anteriorly with dark reticulated blotches which contain lighter colored scales in the center.  Posteriorly, these dark blotches fade in color, and merge with darker colored patches laterally to form rhombic shaped bands.  A dark band or crown is usually present on top of the head [in between the eyes and extending to the snout](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/24874677?size=large), and a [dark postocular stripe](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/172271?size=large) usually terminates at or before the corner of the mouth.  The tail is dark, sometimes [completely black or nearly so](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/5052461?size=large), inspiring the common name.
