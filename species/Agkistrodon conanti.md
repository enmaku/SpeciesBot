Florida Cottonmouths *Agkistrodon conanti* are one of two recognized species of large (76-122 cm record 189.2 cm) venomous semi-aquatic pitviper in eastern North America. Endemic to Florida, Southeastern Alabama and Georgia, it exchanges genes in a zone of admixture where it contacts continental *Agkistrodon piscivorus*.

Florida Cottonmouths are generalists and eat anything they can overpower, including fish, amphibians, small mammals and carrion.

The *Agkistrodon piscivorus* species complex has been delimited using modern molecular methods and two species with no subspecies are recognized. There is a zone of admixture between the two cottonmouth species where they overlap around panhandle Florida.
