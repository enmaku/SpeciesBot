Prairie Kingsnakes *Lampropeltis calligaster* are medium-sized non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the Yellow-bellied Kingsnake species complex. Prairie Kingsnakes are found in the west of the Mississippi River in the plains states and the range crosses the Mississippi River embayment east to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, favoring
prairie and pastureland habitat. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range and from ratsnakes like Cornsnakes by their lack of keels.
