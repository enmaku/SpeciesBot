Sidewinders *Crotalus cerastes* are small to medium sized (43-61cm, record 84cm) rattlesnakes that range from central-eastern California east into southern Nevada and extreme southwestern Utah, south into southern California, western and southern Arizona, northwestern Sonora, MX (including Tibur√≥n Island), and northeastern Baja California.  They utilize a wide variety of arid habitats, from open desert, to dunes, semi-desert grassland, desert-scrub, rocky slopes, and favor low mounds topped with grass or shrubs within those environments.  Their main prey is lizards and rodents.

Sidewinders are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites are uncommon and no human fatalities have been recorded for this species.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Color is variable; dorsally, varies from cream to yellowish, beige, tan, brown, orange, pinkish, or grey, patterned with darker blotches dorsally.  A pair of prominent horns, one above each eye, makes it relatively easy to distinguish sidewinders from other rattlesnakes that overlap in range.
