Striped Whipsnakes *Masticophis taeniatus* are medium-large (107-152cm, up to 183cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from central Washington and southern Idaho south through eastern California, Arizona, as far east as central Texas, and as far south as northern Guanajuato and northeastern Jalisco, MX, from sea level up to 3,075m.  They principally inhabit brushy areas such as scrubland, semidesert scrub, arid grassland, and open mixed woodland, especially along the perimeters of streams and other bodies of water.

Diurnal in habit, *M. taeniatus* are swift-moving snakes that are commonly observed actively foraging for prey with the head and forebody elevated to increase their range of vision.  They also readily ascend bushes and trees to find prey or evade predators.  Their favorite prey is lizards, but rodents, snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), frogs, small birds, and insects are also frequently consumed.

Long and very slender in form, *M. taeniatus* have an elongate head and large eyes.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 15 rows across at midbody.  [The dark scales on the top of head are light colored along the seams](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/100473004?size=large), which helps distinguish them from other *Masticophis* whipsnakes with striped patterns.  The dorsal coloration is black or a dark shade of brown or grey.  Western and northern populations exhibit [at least one pair of light colored lateral stripes which are broken up by dark stripes and dashes in between](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/61032406?size=large).  Those lateral stripes are reduced in populations further east and south, and in some [older, darker individuals, might be reduced to patches](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/5457763?size=large).  The [underside of the tail is pinkish in coloration](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/46952987?size=large) and the anal scale is divided.

Striped Whipsnakes are sometimes confused with *Thamnophis* gartersnakes.  The latter differ by having strongly keeled scales and an undivided anal scale.  *Salvadora* patchnose snakes might also be confused occasionally, but they have a distinctively enlarged, triangular rostral scale, 17 dorsal scale rows at midbody, and a prominent middorsal stripe which *M. taeniatus* lacks.
