Leopard Snakes *Zamenis situla* are medium sized (70-90cm, up to 116cm), harmless colubrine snakes that range from the Mediterranean coast of Croatia, southeastern Peninsular Italy, and southeastern Sicily south and east through Greece into western Turkey, with an isolated population in the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine, from sea level to 1,600m.  Also present on many large and small Mediterranean islands, including Crete and Malta.  

Leopard Snakes mainly inhabit dry, rocky areas such as Mediterranean scrub, field edges, and riparian corridors, especially near water, and usually below 700m.  They can also be common near areas of human habitation, where they utilize embankments, gardens, agricultural areas, stone walls, and old ruins. Mainly diurnal in habit, they are strong climbers and can occasionally be found in trees, shrubs, or on walls.  Prey is mainly rodents, but other small mammals, small birds, and lizards are sometimes taken.

Moderately slender in build, *Z. situla* have a slender, elongate head, and moderately sized eyes with a reddish colored iris.  They have smooth dorsal scales which are usually arranged in 27 (25-29) rows at midbody.  There are usually 8 (7-9) supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, one preocular, and two postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
