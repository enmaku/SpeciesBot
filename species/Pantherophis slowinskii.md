Slowinski's Cornsnakes *Pantherophis slowinskii* are harmless ratsnakes native to Louisiana and Texas. Like other cornsnakes, they are generalists and eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.

Slowinksi's Cornsnakes are currently recognized as distinct from cornsnakes *P. guttatus*, as well as Emory's Ratsnake *P. emoryi*.
