The Southern Hog-nosed Snake *Heterodon simus* is a harmless colubrid snake with keeled scales native to the southeastern US. It can be distinguished from Eastern Hog-nosed snake *Heterodon platirhinos* by a [more upturned snout and consistent belly coloration](http://projectsimusflorida.synthasite.com/eastern-hognose-comparison.php). Adults are relatively small, yet stocky, rarely exceeding 20 inches in length (44-55 cm, record 61 cm). The primary habitats for these snakes are dry uplands - particularly sandhill and scrub biomes - but they may occasionally be found in [hammocks](https://goo.gl/NZbhGh) or transient wetlands. Like other hog-nosed species, an upturned snout is the defining feature of this snake used to burrow in the sand to search for toads and other small reptiles, which are their primary food source.
 
Hog-nosed snakes are known for their impressive threat displays, which can include loud hissing, puffing of the body, mock striking and flattening of the neck, however they rarely actually bite. This incredible act leads to being mistakenly identified as cobras or other dangerous species by people unfamiliar with this behavior. When excessively harassed, hog-nosed snakes are capable of "playing dead", which consists of them rolling onto their backs and hanging their mouths open, throwing their tongue out and spreading a thick musk secreted from the cloaca.
 
Although medically insignificant to humans, hog-nosed snakes deliver a mild, low pressure venom through grooved rear fangs. Common in dipsadine snakes, it helps to immobilize prey and reduce handling time. 

Heterodon simus is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN, and habitat loss continues to threaten the species throughout its extant range. Did you see one? [Please report it here!](https://public.myfwc.com/fwri/raresnakes/GetLatLong.aspx?id=shn)
