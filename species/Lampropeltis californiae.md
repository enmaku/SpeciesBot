California kingsnakes *Lampropeltis californiae* are large (76-122 cm record 200 cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the getula species complex. California Kingsnakes range from west of the continental divide to the Pacific ocean, overlapping with the Desert Kingsnake *Lampropeltis splendida* at the Cochise Filter Barrier. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes are immune to the venom of the species on which they prey. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range.

A wide variety of color patterns make California Kingsnakes very popular in the pet trade.
