Horseshoe Whipsnakes *Hemorrhois hippocrepis*, are large (up to 1.75m) colubrid snakes that range across southern Iberia and along the Mediterranean coastline of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.  Additional populations have been introduced to some of the islands in the Mediterranean Sea.  They use a variety of habitats, including rocky or sandy scrubland, valleys, grassland, and farmland, and are often common around areas of human habitation, where they inhabit rock walls, parks, gardens, outbuildings, and old ruins.  Favored prey is rodents, but lizards, smaller snakes, birds, and insects are sometimes taken.

A [distinctive marking](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/117122104?size=large) on the back of the head, which sometimes resembles a horseshoe, lends the species its common name.  This bat-winged marking is sometimes obscure or lost in older, darker colored individuals.  Whipsnakes have smooth scalesarranged in 25-29 rows at midbody with a divided anal plate.

The Background color of Horseshoe Whipsnakes is typically light but variable in young individuals (yellow, olive, tan, brown, or pinkish), [boldly patterned](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/51506359?size=large) with darker dorsal blotches (round, oval, elliptical, or diamond shaped), alternating with dark spots on the lateral surface, and light flecking on the edge of some of the darker scales.  The color darkens with age, sometimes obscuring the pattern of alternating blotches and spots, leaving a [dark animal with light colored speckling](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/115743265?size=large).  The belly is usually orange or pink, but sometimes whitish or yellow, and is patterned with dark spots and/or mottling.
