Saltmarsh Snakes *Nerodia clarkii* are medium sized (50-76cm, record 93.3cm) New World natricine snakes that range along the southeastern US coastline from the Atlantic coast of Florida west to southeastern Texas, with an introduced population on the northern coast of Cuba.  They chiefly inhabit coastal wetlands with brackish water, including saltmarsh, mangrove swamp, and mud flats, but are sometimes found in freshwater habitat, especially on the Florida Keys.

Like other *Nerodia* watersnakes, *N. clarkii* often puff up or flatten their bodies when they feel threatened.  When seized, then often secrete a foul smelling musk from the cloaca and may also bite.  Mild anticoagulant toxins in the saliva might be effective for handling their main prey, small fish and crustaceans, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need mild soap and water, or some hand sanitizer.

*N. clarkii* have strongly keeled scales usually arranged in 21 rows at midbody.  The anal scale is divided.  They hybridize in some areas with the closely related banded water snake, *N. fasciata*, and in these areas some individuals might be difficult to tell apart.  They are sometimes confused with other, similar looking natricines, and occasionally with venomous cottonmouths.  Some characteristics for differentiating these snakes include;
* venomous *Agkistrodon* cottonmouths, have larger, chunkier heads with proportionally smaller eyes, and a prominent, angular, facial ridge ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)) which protrudes over the eye like a brow, and gives the snake a [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039) and partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/). Post !cottonwater to trigger a bot reply with a more comprehensive breakdown.
* other *Nerodia* watersnakes in range usually have 23 or more dorsal scale rows
* *Thamnophis* garter snakes in range have 19 dorsal scale rows and an undivided anal scale
* *Regina* crayfish snakes and *Liodytes* swamp snakes in range have 19 or fewer dorsal scale rows and a smaller head, usually with proportionally larger eyes
