Urartian Rat Snakes *Elaphe urartica* are large (80-120cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from southwestern Dagestan in Russia southwest to eastern Turkey and south and southwest into northern Iran, from sea level to 2,600m.  Up until recently, *E. urartica* was considered a population of the blotched rat snake *E. sauromates*, a similar and closely related species which ranges to the west and north.

Urartian Rat Snakes chiefly inhabit steppe, semi-desert, open woodland, montane forest, and montane meadow.  Presumably, they are similar in habit to the blotched rat snake *E. sauromates*, and are likely diurnal or crepuscular in habit and probably prey on small mammals, birds, and bird eggs.

Moderately robust in build, *E. urartica* have a fairly large head with moderately sized eyes.  The dorsal scales are weakly keeled and usually arranged in 25 (23-25) rows at midbody.  The eyes are moderate in size and the head is fairly large.  There are usually 8 (8-9) supralabials, and there are 1-2 preoculars, sometimes a small presubocular (sandwiched in between the anterior part of the eye and supralabials 3 & 4), and usually 2 (1-3) postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
