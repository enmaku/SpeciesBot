Barred Grass Snakes *Natrix helvetica* are small (54.1-83.5 cm record 205 cm) harmless natricine snakes with keeled scales. They and their sister species the Grass Snake *N. natrix* are the most commonly encountered snakes in Europe. Barred Grass Snakes are active semiaquatic foragers - their diet consists mostly of amphibians and fish.

Recent work shows that two species of grass snake speciated in separate refugia and have expanded out since the last ice age (pleistocene), with the Rhine in Germany serving as a biographraphic seperator between two species, with snakes west of the river elevated to their own status as Barred Grass Snakes *Natrix helvetica*. See the range map for details.
