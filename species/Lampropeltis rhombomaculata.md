Mole Kingsnakes *Lampropeltis rhombomaculata* are medium-sized non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the Yellow-bellied Kingsnake species complex. Mole Kingsnakes are found in the eastern US from in the state of Mississippi, favoring eastern dry pine and oak forests south to Louisiana, east to eastern Tennessee and the panhandle of Florida as well as on the Piedmont northwards along the eastern seaboard. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range and from ratsnakes like Cornsnakes by their lack of keels.
