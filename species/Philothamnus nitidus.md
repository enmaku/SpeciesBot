Green Bush Snakes *Philothamnus nitidus* are medium sized (50-80cm, up to 99cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from Sierra Leone east into far western Kenya, south into Tanzania and extreme northern Angola, from near sea level up to 1,200m.  They chiefly inhabit well vegetated areas, especially near water, in forest, forest edges and clearings, and moist savanna and can sometimes be common around areas of human habitation.  Diurnal and largely arboreal in habit, they spend most of their time in trees and shrubs.  Their main prey is frogs, though lizards are also believed to be taken occasionally.

Like other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. nitidus* are sometimes confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Green Bush Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 9 supralabials with 4-6 in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which is in contact with the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There are 1-2 anterior and 2 posterior temporal scales.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals and subcaudals are laterally keeled.
