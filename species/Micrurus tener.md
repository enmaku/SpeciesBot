The Western or Texas Coralsnake *Micrurus tener* is a medium-sized (<80 cm record 121.3 cm) nocturnal or crepuscular venomous elapid snake with smooth scales. Native to Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana through Mexico, they are found in dry habitats such as mixed hardwood, prairie and thornscrub, though they may occasionally be found in riparian areas. They are reclusive snakes who spend the majority of their time buried under brush or soil.
 
Coralsnakes posses a potent venom comprised mainly of neurotoxins which they use to incapacitate their prey. Their primary food source is other snakes (including their own species) but they may also eat lizards, birds, frogs, fish, and insects. While rare due to their docile and reclusive nature, a bite from a coralsnake is a medical emergency and can be fatal or disabling without prompt treatment. Popular rhymes such as "Red and yellow kill a fellow/Red and black friend of jack" are often used to distinguish coralsnakes from non-venomous mimics such as the Scarlet King snake or the Scarlet Snake. While accurate in some regions, there are many venomous species that invalidate the rhyme outside of the United States. Within the range of the Micrurus fulvius, often the quickest way to identify coralsnakes is to simply look for a black "nose".
 
Coralsnakes *Micrurus* and *Micruroides* are North America's only native members of the family Elapidae, which also contains cobras, kraits, and many other notable venomous snakes. 

*M. tener* is considered distinct from the eastern coralsnake *M. fulvius*, and while there are morphological differences, the two species can be distinguished easily by geographic range.
