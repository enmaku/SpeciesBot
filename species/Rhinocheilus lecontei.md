Long-nosed Snakes *Rhinocheilus lecontei* are small (60-80 cm, record 104.1 cm) secretive snakes found in arid grassland, sandhill and desert habitat. They spend the majority of their time underground but emerge in the hours following sunset and primarily eat lizards and their eggs, rodents, insects, and sometimes other snakes. They have smooth scales and an undivided cloacal plate. Most commonly encountered on roads at night, but occasionally found in developed areas.

When threatened, these snakes secrete bloody fluid, writhe, and coil themselves to hide their head.
