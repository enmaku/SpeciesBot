Redbelly snakes *Storeria occipitomaculata* are small (21-27 cm, record 40.6 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in disturbed habitats like urban and suburban yards, and on slopes with small flippable rocks. They are commonly encountered snakes and make good pest control as they feast on small, soft-bodied invertebrates. Sometimes difficult to distinguish from brownsnakes from above, redbelly snakes are often less patterned and have the namesake red belly.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes may puff up or flatten out defensively, but are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom. They are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.
