Emory's Ratsnake *Pantherophis emoryi* are harmless ratsnakes found in the plains states of North America through Northern Mexico. Like other ratsnakes, they are generalists and eat a variety of prey. Often found in rural areas, they are particularly fond of rodents and birds.

Emory's Ratsnakes are currently recognized as distinct from cornsnakes *P. guttatus* and *P. slowinskii*.
