Sonoran Whipsnakes *Masticophis bilineatus* are medium-large (61-150cm, up to 170cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from central Arizona south to Colima, MX, and east as far as Aguascalientes, MX, from sea level up to 2,500m.  Their favored habitat is rocky, well vegetated slopes and valleys, especially near water, but they also utilize semidesert scrub, arid grassland, and open montane woodland.

Diurnal in habit, *M. bilineatus* are swift-moving snakes that are often observed actively foraging for prey with the head and forebody elevated to increase their range of vision.  They also readily ascend bushes and trees to find prey or evade predators.  Their favorite prey is lizards, but rodents, snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), frogs, and small birds are also commonly consumed.

Sonoran Whipsnakes are long and very slender in form, with an elongate head and large eyes.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 17 rows across at midbody.  The dorsal coloration is grey-green, [blue-grey](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/162385898?size=original), dark grey, [grey-brown](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/25150842?size=original), or olive anteriorly, fading to a light yellowish-brown or yellow-green around midbody, and then darker again toward the tail.  2 or 3 pairs of light colored lateral stripes are often present anteriorly, but fade around midbody.  The underside of the tail is yellowish, and the anal scale is divided.

Other snakes which are commonly confused with *M. bilineatus*, are best differentiated as follows; 

* Striped whipsnakes *M. taeniatus* are usually darker dorsally, [the dark scales on top of the head are light colored at the edges](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/100473004?size=large), and they have 15 dorsal scale rows at midbody 
* *Thamnophis* gartersnakes have strongly keeled scales and an undivided anal scale
* *Salvadora* patchnose snakes have a distinctively enlarged, triangular rostral scale and a prominent middorsal stripe which *M. bilineatus* lacks
