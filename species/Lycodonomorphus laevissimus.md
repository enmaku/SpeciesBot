Dusky-Bellied Water Snakes *Lycodonomorphus laevissimus* are medium sized (60-100cm, up to 120cm), harmless lamprophiid snakes that range from Eswatini and northeastern South Africa south into southeastern South Africa, from sea level to 1,715m.  The primarily inhabit bodies of water, especially streams, rivers, ponds, and reservoirs within grassland or woodland.  

More aquatic than sympatric *Lycodonomorphus* water snakes, *L. laevissimus* are most commonly found submerged underwater.  Active by day or night, they are constrictors and primarily consume aquatic prey such as frogs, tadpoles, and fish.

Dusky-Bellied Water Snakes have smooth dorsal scales which are usually arranged in 19 (19-21) rows at midbody.  The head is fairly small, and the eyes are moderate in size.  There are usually 8 supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, 1 preocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are paired.
