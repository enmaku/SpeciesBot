Striped Sandsnakes *Psammophis sibilans* are medium-large (100-120cm, up to 175cm), mildly venomous, psammophiid snakes that range from the northeastern coast of African Egypt south to the Horn of Africa and northern Kenya, from sea level to 2,500m.  They inhabit a wide variety of grassy and scrubby habitat, usually near water, and frequently occur around areas of human habitation, where they occupy agricultural areas, irrigation canals, ditches, meadows, and gardens.

*P. sibilans* are mildly venomous, rear-fanged snakes; envenomation is uncommon and usually mild, but prolonged, chewing bites should be avoided as a precaution.  They are extraordinarily wary, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and harassed**.  Diurnal in habit, this active, swift moving, and vision oriented hunters preys opportunistically on small mammals, lizards, snakes, frogs, and small birds.

Striped Sandsnakes have smooth scales arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 8 supralabials, an elongate loreal, a preocular, and usually 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
