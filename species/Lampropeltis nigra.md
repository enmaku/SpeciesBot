Black kingsnakes *Lampropeltis nigra* are large (90-122 cm record 183 cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the getula species complex. Black Kingsnakes range from east of the Mississippi River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous snakes. Kingsnakes are immune to the venom of the species on which they prey. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range.
