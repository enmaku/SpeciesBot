Brown Forest Cobras *Naja subfulva* are large (140-170cm, up to 270cm) elapids that range from southwestern Cameroon east into western Ethiopia and the southern coast of Kenya, south into Angola and northeastern South Africa, from near sea level up to 2,500m.  Isolated populations might also be present in west-central Chad and southeastern Somalia.  They utilize a wide variety of treed habitat, including dense forest, open woodland, mesic savanna, and coastal thicket, especially near water.  They are primarily nocturnal, but are commonly also active by day.  Their diet is highly varied and consists mainly of frogs, rodents, snakes (including other cobras), lizards, small birds, and fish.

Dangerously venomous, *N. subfulva* should only be observed from a safe distance.  When frightened, they often raise the forebody off the ground and spread the neck into a long, somewhat narrow hood and might strike if the perceived aggressor does not back off.  They do not need to spread a hood in order to bite.  Attempting to kill or capture a snake dramatically increases the risk of being bitten.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**
  
Brown Forest Cobras are somewhat slender or moderate in build.  The head is short but chunky, with small or moderately sized eyes, and a blunt snout.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 19-27 rows at the neck and usually in 19 (17-21) rows at midbody, except along the coast of East Africa, where the typical number at midbody is 17.  There are usually 7 supralabials with the 3rd and 4th in contact with the eye, usually 1 preocular, and usually 3 postoculars.  No subocular scales are present.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are divided.
