Nubian Spitting Cobras *Naja nubiae* are medium-large (70-120cm, up to 151cm) elapids with a disjunct range from central Niger east to Eritrea, and up the Nile Valley north into Egypt, from near sea level up to 1,200m above sea level.  They primarily inhabit moist and well vegetated microhabitat within arid savanna, semi-desert, rocky/scrubby hillsides, and riparian corridors.  They are mainly nocturnal, but can be active during the day.  Their primary prey is frogs, but rodents, lizards, snakes, and small birds are also consumed.

Dangerously venomous, *N. nubiae* should only be observed from a safe distance.   When frightened, they often raise the forebody off the ground, spread the neck into a long, narrow hood, and hiss loudly.  They are also capable of "spitting" their venom, and can aim accurately up to 3m away.  If it gets in the eyes, care must be taken to gently flush them out with water or other inert liquid as soon as possible to prevent permanent damage, and medical care should be sought.  They are capable of biting and/or ejecting venom without first spreading a hood.  Attempting to kill or capture the snake dramatically increases the risk of being bitten.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**
  
Nubian Spitting Cobras are somewhat slender or moderate in build.  The head is somewhat small, with relatively large eyes and a blunt snout.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 23-29 rows at the neck and usually 25 (23-27) rows at midbody.  There are usually 7 (6-8) supralabials with 4th and sometimes 3rd in contact with the eye, usually 1 (1-2) preoculars, and usually 3 (2-3) postoculars.  A single subocular scale is sometimes present.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are divided.
