Speckled Green Snakes *Philothamnus punctatus* are medium sized (75-110cm, up to 120cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from northwestern Somalia south into northern Mozambique, and east into southern Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjacent Zambia, from 200m up to 1,500m.  They can be found in a wide variety of habitat ranging from mesic to arid, including savanna, open woodland, thickets, forest edges and clearings, and semi-desert.  They can also often be found in disturbed or even urban areas, where they inhabit agricultural areas, parks, and gardens.  

Primarily diurnal in habit, *P. punctatus* are semiarboreal and spend much of their time in shrubs and trees where they hunt lizards.  Frogs are occasionally taken, as well.

Like many other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. punctatus* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the black skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Speckled Green Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are 9 supralabials with the 5th and 6th in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which is in contact with the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There are usually 2 anterior and 2 posterior temporal scales.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals and subcaudals are laterally keeled.
