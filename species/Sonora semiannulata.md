Groundsnakes *Sonora semiannulata* are small (21.5-30.6cm, record 48.3 cm) North American colubrid snakes that range through much of the western US and northern Mexico, from northwestern Nevada south into northern Baja California, MX, and east to the Rio Grande Valley in west Texas and south again into Jalisco, MX and east to Nuevo Leon, MX. A disjunct population in southeastern Oregon and southwestern Idaho represents the northern limit of the genus.
  
*Sonora semiannulata* are harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. They inhabit a wide variety of arid and semiarid habitat, especially those with loose or rocky soils.  Semi-fossorial in habit, their diet consists of centipedes, spiders, scorpions, insects, and other invertebrates.

*Sonora semiannulata* lay eggs.  Their dorsal scales are smooth, glossy in appearance, and arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The anal scale is divided and a loreal scale is present on the face.  This species formerly included *S. episcopa* and *S. mosaueri*, from which it can't reliably be differentiated morphologically, and *S. taylori*, which can be differentiated by having only 13 scale rows at midbody.  These species are best differentiated by range, but the precise boundaries between *S. semiannulata* and *S. episcopa* in southern NM, southwestern TX, and Coahuila, MX, as well as that between *S. semiannulata* and *S. mosaueri* in Baja California, have yet to be resolved.
