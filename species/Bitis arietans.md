Puff Adders *Bitis arietans* are medium-large (70-110cm, up to 191cm) true vipers that range from the southwestern coast of Morocco east to the Horn of Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula, south through South Africa, from near sea level up to 3,500m.  They can be found in a wide variety of habitat, but are most common in savanna, semi-desert grassland, and scrubland, but are absent from closed-canopy forest and true desert, and uncommon or absent at elevations above 1,700m.  They are often common around areas of human habitation.

Dangerously venomous, *B. arietans* should only be observed from a safe distance.  They are shy and unaggressive, but when frightened, they often [draw the forebody off the ground in a distinctive S-loop](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gabrimtnezmarmol/3893237541/), inflate the body, and hiss loudly to warn away potential tormentors.  If stepped on, seized, or cornered, they are capable of striking vigorously and with great speed, hurling the body off the ground toward the aggressor, and can strike at a distance slightly exceeding that of their own body length.  Accidental bites are unfortunately common in this species, but the risk of bite increases tremendously if an individual attempts to kill or capture the animal.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**
  
Primarily nocturnal, *B. arietans* are sometimes active on rainy or cloudy days.  They are mainly ambush predators, and the bulk of their diet is composed of rodents and other small mammals.  Lizards, snakes, small birds, and frogs are also consumed.  They are primarily ground-dwellers, but some individuals, especially juveniles, will also climb into bushes or enter water.

Puff Adders are very heavy-bodied snakes, with large and distinct heads.  The dorsal scales are strongly keeled and arranged in 28-41 rows at midbody.  The head is covered by a large number of small, mostly keeled scales, and the eyes are positioned somewhat dorsally.  There are 12-17 supralabials, which are separated from the eye by 3-4 rows of smaller scales.  The anal scale is single, but the subcaudals are divided.
