Mississippi Green Watersnakes *Nerodia cyclopion* are medium-large (76-114cm, record 129.5cm), robustly built, New World natricine snakes that range along the southeastern coastal plains from the extreme western Florida panhandle west into southeastern Texas, and along the Mississippi River drainage from extreme southwestern Illinois south through Arkansas and Louisiana.  They chiefly inhabit calm, slow moving waters, including shallow ponds and lakes, ditches, bayous, swamps, marshes, sluggish sections of rivers and streams, and sometimes utilizing brackish water.

Like other *Nerodia* watersnakes, *N. cyclopion* often puff up or flatten their bodies when they feel threatened.  When seized, then often secrete a foul smelling musk from the cloaca and may also bite.  Mild anticoagulant toxins in the saliva might be effective for handling their main prey, fish and frogs, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need mild soap and water, or some hand sanitizer.

*N. cyclopion* have strongly keeled scales arranged in 27-29 rows at midbody.  The eyes are positioned somewhat dorsally (toward the top of the head, rather than the side), and there is a row of subocular scales separating the supralabials (upper lip scales) from the eye.  The anal scale is divided.  The belly is dark with light colored spots and/or crescent markings.  They are sometimes confused with other *Nerodia* watersnakes, as well as venomous *Agkistrodon* cottonmouths.  Some characteristics for differentiating these snakes include;
* venomous *Agkistrodon* cottonmouths, have larger, chunkier heads with proportionally smaller eyes, and a prominent, angular, facial ridge ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)) which protrudes over the eye like a brow, and gives the snake a [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039) and partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/).

* *N. erythrogaster*, *N. fasciata*, *N. clarkii*, and *N. sipedon* usually have 21-23 dorsal scale rows at midbody, more laterally positioned eyes, and lack subocular scales
* *N. taxispilota* lack subocular scales, and have smaller, fragmented parietal and temporal scales
* *N. floridana* has a light colored belly with dark markings near the tail, and generally avoids well forested wetlands and water bodies
