Eastern Copperheads *Agkistrodon contortrix*, are one of two recognized species of copperhead pit vipers. Adult copperheads are medium-sized  snakes (61-90.0 cm record 132.1 cm) that live in a range of habitats, from terrestrial to semi-aquatic, including rocky, forested hillsides and wetlands. They can also be found within cities where wooded areas are present, such as city parks. They also will hang out where there is deadfall; [their camouflage is perfect for this!](https://www.wilx.com/content/news/Viral-photo-shows-copperhead-snakes-amazing-camouflage-420376274.html). When young, Eastern Copperheads are known to readily consume cicadas as a major part of their diet. As they grow they switch to larger prey like small mammals and amphibians.
 
 
Many people find it helpful to liken the pattern of the Eastern Copperhead *Agkistrodon contortrix* to ["Hershey kisses."](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/GEM6GJ/northern-copperhead-agkistrodon-contortrix-mokasen-native-to-eastern-GEM6GJ.jpg) The bands on Broadbanded Copperheads *Agkistrodon laticinctus* do not narrow at the top of the snake.
 
Eastern copperheads are venomous but usually only bite humans or pets in self-defense. As with many blotched snakes, their first line of defense is to freeze in place or flee. Copperheads also shake and vibrate the tail in self defense and as a caudal lure.

The *Agkistrodon contortrix* species complex has been delimited using modern molecular methods and two species with no subspecies are recognized. There is a wide zone of admixture between the two copperhead species where they overlap.
