Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes *Sistrurus catenatus* are small-medium sized (47-76cm, up to 100.3cm) pit vipers with a highly fragmented range from northwestern New York west through southern and northeastern Ontario, Canada, into extreme southeastern Minnesota south into east-central Missouri and west-central Pennsylvania.  Populations are declining across their range and isolated populations might be the most sensitive.  The Western Massasauga is now recognized as a distinct species *S. tergeminus*.

Dangerously venomous, *S. catenatus* should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, and may slowly attempt to crawl away while still facing their perceived attacker.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Though *S. catenatus* largely inhabit moist, grassy or shrubby areas, including marsh, swamp, and other wetland, they will also utilize upland prairie, old field, agricultural areas, open woodland and forest during the warmer months.  Chiefly diurnal in habit, they prey primarily on rodents and other small mammals.  Frogs, snakes, birds, bird eggs and insects are also taken.

The pygmy rattlesnake *S. miliarius* can be distinguished from *S. catenatus* by having a proportionally tiny rattle, and by usually having an orange or reddish middorsal stripe.
