Pygmy Rattlesnakes *Sistrurus miliarius* are small (40-50 cm, record 83.2cm) venomous rattlesnakes in the family Viperidae. This species is primarily found in the southeastern United States, ranging as far north as Missouri, south to the Florida Keys, and west to Texas. Although not aquatic, the pygmy rattlesnake prefers moist habitats like pine and oak flatwoods forests not far from water. They are primarily diurnal and tend to be somewhat reclusive, spending the majority of their time taking shelter in rotting logs, leaf litter and the burrows of other animals, eating reptiles, centipedes and small mammals.

This species is significantly smaller than most other rattlesnakes and possesses a tiny rattle, which sounds more like a buzz than the unmistakable rattle of other species. Their coloration varies, but most individuals exhibit a distinct blotchy pattern with dorsal spots alternating between black and a lighter color (typically red or orange). Another defining feature is a black stripe running along the side of the head from the eye area to the corner of the mouth. Juveniles exhibit a distinct yellow coloration at the tip of the tail underneath a small rattle. 

Pygmy rattlesnakes possess a medically significant venom composed primarily of cytotoxins that destroy nucleated blood cells, delivered through a pair of hinged fangs in the front of the mouth. Bites tend to occur when the snake is being intentionally harassed, or when the snake is accidentally stepped on. As with all venomous snakes, the Pygmy Rattlesnake should be given a wide berth and left alone if encountered. Although unlikely to kill an adult human, a bite from this species is a medical emergency and victims should seek prompt treatment.

This species has not been investigated across the landscape using modern molecular methods and likley harbors cryptic diversity unaligned with curent subspecies designations.
