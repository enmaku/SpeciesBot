Western Ratsnakes *Pantherophis obsoletus* are large (record 256.5 cm) common harmless ratsnakes with a multitude of regional color patterns native to west of the Mississippi River Embayment. *Pantherophis* ratsnakes are keeled-scaled generalists that eat a variety of prey. They do well in urban environments, and are particularly fond of rodents and birds in these habitats.

Western Ratsnakes *P. obsoletus* are currently recognized as distinct from Eastern Ratsnakes *Pantherophis quadrivittatus*, as well as Central Ratsnakes *P. alleghaniensis*. Parts of all three species were once generically labeled "black ratsnakes". Use the "!blackrat" command without the space for more on these changes.

Ratsnakes can be easily distinguished from racers *Coluber* by the presence of keeled scales. Racers have smooth scales.
