Angola Green Snakes *Philothamnus angolensis* are medium sized (70-100cm, up to 120cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from western Cameroon and extreme southeastern Nigeria east into South Sudan, and south to central Namibia and the eastern coast of South Africa, with an isolated population in Sudan, from near sea level up to 2,000m.  They are principally found in well vegetated areas alongside waterbodies and wetlands.  

Primarily diurnal in habit, *P. angolensis* are semiarboreal and gracefully cruise through tree branches and shrubs where they actively forage for frogs.  Small birds and lizards are also taken.  They are strong swimmers and can sometimes be found in water.

Like some other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. angolensis* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the black skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Angola Green Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 9 supralabials with 4-6 in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which does not contact the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There is usually 1 (1-2) anterior temporal scale and usually 2 (1-2) posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals are smooth or slightly keeled, and the subcaudals are smooth.
