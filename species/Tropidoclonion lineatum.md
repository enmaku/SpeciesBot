Lined Snakes *Tropidoclonion lineatum* are small (22.4-38cm, record 54.4cm), North American natricine snakes that range spottily through much of the central US from S Wisconsin west to SE South Dakota, southwest into New Mexico and Texas. Semifossorial in habit, typical Lined Snakes favor open grassland, the ecotone between grassland and woodland, residential yards, parks, and gardens, and suburban and urban vacant lots.  Diet consists largely of earthworms, though slugs, isopods, and soft-bodied insects are sometimes taken.

Lined Snakes are harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. Common defensive tactics including flattening out the head and/or body to try to appear larger, thrashing from side to side, and excreting a foul smelling musk from vent.

*T. lineatum* have keeled scales and an undivided anal scale.  Their [pattern of light colored stripes on a darker background](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/70187565?size=original) frequently leads to confusion with their relatives, the garter snakes, *Thamnophis* spp., from which lined snakes can be differentiated by their proportionally small heads, a pattern of [parallel half-moon shaped markings on the venter](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/32801292?size=large), and fewer supralabials (usually 5 or 6).  Other snakes with which they are commonly confused, and the best methods for differentiating them, include;

* Brownsnakes *Storeria* spp., Crayfish Snakes *Regina* spp., and Swampsnakes *Liodytes rigida* all have an undivided anal scale.
* Groundsnakes *Sonora semiannulata* have smooth scales and a divided anal scale.
* Patchnose snakes *Salvadora* spp. have smooth scales, a divided anal scale, and an enlarged rostral scale.

Records from southern WI are recent and not reflected in available range maps.  A lone record from the vicinity of Las Cruces, NM is considered to belong to an introduced individual and is likley not reflected on most available range maps.
