Tiger Rattlesnakes *Crotalus tigris* are small to medium sized (46-61cm, record 91cm) New World pit vipers that range from central and southern Arizona south into southern Sonora, MX (including Tibur√≥n Island). Favored habitat is rocky terrain within scrubland, desert, grassland, and semi-arid woodland, especially on lower slopes and in canyons.  Their main prey is lizards and rodents.

*C. tigris* are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Envenomation is rare and no human fatalities have been recorded for this species.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Moderately stout-bodied, and with a disproportionately small head, their coloration is very variable.  Dorsal coloration ranges from cream to yellow, tan, orange, pink, brown, grey, or blue-grey, often fading into a lighter pink, orange, tan, or cream laterally, and patterned with distinct, but often poorly defined, darker brown or grey crossbands, sometimes alternating with darker grey or brown blotches laterally.

*C. tigris* overlaps in range with several other rattlesnakes.  They are most likley to be confused with the Southwestern speckled rattlesnake, *C. pyrrhus*, which can best be differentiated by their proportionally larger heads and darker bands or rings toward the end of their tails.
