Italian Aesculapian Snakes *Zamenis lineatus* are large (120-150cm, up to 170cm), harmless colubrid snakes native to southern Italy, including Sicily; usually at low elevations, but up to 1,600m.  Primarily associated with edge habitat, including woodland edges, forest clearings, riparian corridors, and Mediterranean scrub.  They are sometimes common around areas of human habitation, where they occupy rock walls, gardens, and old ruins.

*Zamenis lineatus* are strong climbers and can sometimes be found in trees and shrubs.  Mainly diurnal or crepuscular in habit.  Prey is mainly rodents, but other small mammals, small birds, bird eggs, and lizards are sometimes taken.

Italian Aesculapian Snakes have smooth dorsal scales arranged in 23 rows at midbody.  The eyes are moderate in size and the head is proportionally narrow and elongate.  There are usually 8 supralabials (sometimes 9), and there is one preocular, and two postoculars (upper larger).  The anal scale is divided. 

A closely related species, the Aesculapian snake *Z. longissimus* overlaps in range in west-central Italy.  Where they overlap, *Z. lineatus* can be differentiated by a red iris (the iris is a duller brown, grey, or yellow in *Z. longissimus*), a lighter dorsal coloration, and by usually having thinner, better defined, dark longitudinal stripes.  Other species with which it might be confused include the four-lined snake *Elaphe quatuorlineata*, which can be differentiated by having a more robust physique and keeled scales arranged in 25 rows.
