Glossy snakes *Arizona elegans* are medium to large (66-90cm, record 170 cm), North American colubrid snakes that range through much of the western US and northern MX; from the C California coast east to WC Nebraska, south through E Texas to C San Luis Potosi, MX, west to S Sinaloa and C Baja Mexico, MX.  Favored habitat is mostly open, semi-arid to arid areas; various scrubland, grassland, desert, and dry woodland with sandy or loamy soils.  Rodents and lizards form the bulk of their diet.
  
*Arizona elegans* are harmless to people.  If handled or otherwise threatened, they might emit an unpleasant musk or, rarely, bite. Scales are smooth and glossy, which helps differentiate it from the similar bullsnake/gopher snake, *Pituophis catenifer*, as well as ratsnakes, *Pantherophis* spp.
