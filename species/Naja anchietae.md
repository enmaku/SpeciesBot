Anchieta's Cobras *Naja anchietae* are large (130-180cm, up to 231cm) elapids that range from Angola east into Zambia, south into far western Zimbabwe and northern Namibia, from near sea level up to 2,045m.  They mainly inhabit savanna, open woodland, and riparian corridors, especially near wetlands.  They can also be common around areas of human habitation.  Active day and night.  Their diet is highly varied and consists mainly of frogs, small mammals, lizards, snakes (including puff adders), small birds, and bird eggs.

Dangerously venomous, *N. anchietae* should only be observed from a safe distance.  When frightened, they often raise the forebody off the ground, spread the neck into a broad hood, hiss loudly, and might strike if the perceived aggressor does not back off.  Some individuals also briefly charge toward the perceived aggressor.  They do not need to spread a hood in order to bite.  Attempting to kill or capture a snake dramatically increases the risk of being bitten.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**
  
Anchieta's Cobras are moderately robust in build.  The head is short but chunky, with small or moderately sized eyes, and a pointed snout with enlarged rostral scale.  The dorsal scales are smooth and usually arranged in 15-17 rows at the neck and 17 (15-19) rows at midbody.  There are usually 7 (6-8) supralabials, usually 1 preocular, and usually 2 (2-3) postoculars.  A series of 1-3 subocular scales separate the supralabials from the eye.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are divided.
