Western Natal Green Snakes *Philothamnus occidentalis* are medium sized (70-100cm, up to 120cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from northeastern South Africa and western Eswatini south to the southern South African cape, from near sea level up to 2,000m.  According to some authors there might also be an isolated population in central Zimbabwe.
  
*Philothamnus occidentalis* mainly inhabit well vegetated areas within forest, forest edges and clearings, savanna, and grassland, especially near water.  They can also be common around areas of human habitation, where they utilize parks, dams, and residential gardens.  Diurnal and largely arboreal in habit, they spend much of their time in trees and shrubs near water where they actively forage for frogs and lizards.

Like many other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. occidentalis* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the black skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Western Natal Green Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 8 (8-9) supralabials with the 4th and 5th in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which does not contact the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There are usually 2 (1-2) anterior temporal scale and usually 2 (1-3) posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals are laterally keeled, but the subcaudals are smooth.
