Olive Snakes *Lycodonomorphus inornatus* are medium sized (70-90cm, up to 130cm), harmless lamprophiid snakes that range across eastern and southern South Africa and Eswatini, from near sea level up to 1, 780m.  They primarily inhabit moist savanna, mesic forest, grassland, and scrub, especially in low-lying areas or near water.  They can be common in and around areas of human habitation.

Mainly nocturnal in habit, *L. inornatus* are powerful constrictors and prey primarily on rodents and snakes, though shrews and other small mammals, lizards, and frogs are also taken.

Olive Snakes have smooth, glossy dorsal scales arranged in 21-25 rows at midbody.  The head is shaped similarly to those of pythons; distinct at the neck and tapering toward the snout.  The eyes are large or very large and have vertical pupils.  There are 8 supralabials with 3-5 in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular, and 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is single and the subcaudals are paired.
