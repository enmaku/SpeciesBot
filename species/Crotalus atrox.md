Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes *Crotalus atrox* are a wide-ranging species of rattlesnake found in western North America. They are large (<150cm record 233.7 cm) venomous pit vipers that eat primarily small mammals.
 
Western diamondback rattlesnakes are venomous and will bite in self-defense, preferring to flee if given a chance. They will often raise their bodies off the ground and move away hissing loudly and rattling their tail as an anti-predator display.
 
The dorsal coloration of this snake varies tremendously over its range, though typically it is best characterized by diamond-shaped markings on a tan or brown base color with a black and white banded tail. A similar species the Mojave rattlesnake *Crotalus scutulatus* has two scales in between the eyes where *Crotalus atrox* has many. Other characters are subjective or not as consistent.
 
Counting segments in rattles is not an effective way to tell the age of a rattlesnake because snakes can shed more than once per year and grow a new segment with every shed. Rattles are easily broken off or damaged.
