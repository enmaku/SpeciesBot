Pine Woods Snakes *Rhadinaea flavilata* are small (25-33 cm record 40.3 cm) nocturnal dipsadine colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a [group of 20+ "littersnakes"](http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/advanced_search?taxon=snake&genus=rhadinaea&location=-madagascar&submit=Search) found in the Western Hemishphere from North Carolina to Argentina. Pine Woods Snakes are found in pine flatwoods, sandhills and other damp areas with deep leaf litter. While they exist primarily on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, [isolated populations are occasionally discovered](https://doi.org/10.15560/12.3.1913). These snakes eat small ampbians, lizards, snakes and small mammals. As dipsadines, they kill by simply overpowering prey, moving larger items to the rear of the mouth where an oozey, low pressure venom is administered via specialized rear teeth. Range, a dark stripe through the eye and general two-tone color pattern can be used to distinguish this from other similar small snakes.
