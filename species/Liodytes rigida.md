Glossy Crawfish Snakes *Regina rigida* are medium-sized (record 79.7), highly aquatic natricine snakes found along the eastern US coastal plan from North Carolina to Texas, excluding the southern Florida peninsula. They are brownish olive in color with faint dark strips running the length of their bodies. Their scales are highly keeled. Their venters (belly) are light yellow with two rows of dark spots running from head to tail.

Glossy Crawfish snakes can be found in a number of different wetland habitats including blackwater and cypress swamps, ponds and lakes, Carolina bays and roadside ditches.

Like other members of the genus *Regina*, Glossy Crawfish snakes primarily feeds on crayfish. They have specialized teeth that enable them to ingest hard shelled prey, but will also eat frogs, salamanders, small fish and dragonfly larva when crayfish are scarce.

They are secretive, and rarely encountered.

McVay and colleagues, attempting to create a robust phylogeny of watersnakes, reorganized taxonomic names in an attempt to make groups monophyletic, placing small closely related crawfish snakes in the genus Liodytes. [Link](https://carstenslab.osu.edu/Publication_files/McVay.etal.2015.pdf)
