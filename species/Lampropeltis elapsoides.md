Scarlet Kingsnakes *Lampropeltis elapsoides* are small (record 68.6 cm) non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of seven species of milk and kingsnakes called the triangulum species complex. Scarlet Kingsnakes are found in southeastern North America. They kill by overpowering their prey and will eat mainly squamates and their eggs. Scarlet Kingsnakes are variable in color - geographic range helps greatly in identification and to distinguish them from other species. They can be distinguished from Scarlet Snakes *Cemophora coccinea* by their complete color bands - Scarlet Snakes have white saddles rather than complete body banding.

This recent multi-locus work is well done, published in a high-tier journal and was well-received by those who understand the coalescent. It's supported by morphological work (Link 2) and has been adopted by the major North American herp societies. Now directly tested, there is no evidence that this species has elevated gene flow with *Lampropeltis triangulum* along the Atlantic coast - color pattern is under heavy local selection and isn't a good indicator of evolutionary history.
