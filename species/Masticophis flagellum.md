Coachwhips *Masticophis flagellum* are non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth, overlapping scales, long (100-150 cm record 259 cm), slender bodies and large eyes which aid in hunting. Coachwhips are active generalist foragers and prey is simply overpowered and consumed - their diet consists mostly of lizards, amphibians, rodents, birds, and other snakes, including venomous snakes, but they will eat anything they can fit down their throat. A widely distributed species, their range covers the majority of the souther half of the US from the west coast to the east coast and into Mexico.
 
Coachwhips can be [unicolored](https://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?enlarge=0000+0000+0211+0731) or [multicolored](http://herpsofnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Masticophis-flagellum-5.16.03-Kiawah-I.-SC-top-copy.jpg). Juveniles may have a strong [pattern](https://srelherp.uga.edu/snakes/pics/masfla5.jpg) that fades away in the first and second year.
 
Coachwhips get their common name from their resemblance to a braided whip, especially in the last 1/3 of the body and tail. They also are  known to [periscope](https://www.flickr.com/photos/115438345@N04/13858015575), which they do as part of their active, visual prey detection and predator avoidance behavior.

Taxonomy in the Masticophis / Coluber group has been historically difficult, but recent authors retain use of *Masticophis* for the time being. *Masticophis flagellum*  has strong phylogeographic structure and is likely composed of multiple independent species. It has been investigated with modern molecular methods but on a phylogenetic rather than phylogeographic level, and taxonomic revision of cryptic lineages has not occurred yet.
