South Florida Mole Kingsnakes *Lampropeltis occipitolineata* are medium-sized non-venomous colubrid snakes with smooth scales, part of a group of kingsnakes called the Yellow-bellied Kingsnake species complex. South Florida Mole Kingsnakes are found in endangered wet prairie habitats in South Florida. They kill by constriction and will eat mainly rodents, lizards, and other snakes. Individuals are variable and are best distinguished from other similar kingsnakes by geographic range and from ratsnakes like Cornsnakes by their lack of keels.
