Schott's Whipsnakes *Masticophis schotti* are medium-large (102-142cm, up to 168cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from central Texas and northern Coahuila, MX south to northern Veracruz and northern Michoacán, MX, from sea level up to 2,395m.  They principally inhabit arid, scrubby areas such as thornbrush, open woodland, and savanna, especially alongside streams and other bodies of water.

Diurnal in habit, *M. schotti* are swift-moving snakes most commonly observed actively foraging for prey with the head and forebody elevated to increase their range of vision.  They also readily ascend bushes and trees to find prey or evade predators.  Their favorite prey is lizards, but rodents, snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), frogs, small birds, and insects are also commonly consumed.

Long and very slender in form, *M. schotti* have an elongate head and large eyes.  The dorsal scales are smooth and arranged in 15 rows across at midbody.  The dorsal coloration is [greenish or bluish grey anteriorly](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/171533517?size=large) [(olive green or blue-green in southern populations)](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/183994337?size=large) and fading to a duller grey-brown posteriorly (reddish brown in southern populations) and sometimes reddish brown toward the tail.  Northern populations usually exhibit a pair of light colored lateral stripes; on scale row 1 and adjacent ventral scales (present, but usually reduced in southern populations), and another one positioned higher on scale rows 3 & 4, which fades posteriorly (and is reduced or absent in southern populations).  The underside of the tail is usually pinkish or red, and the anal scale is divided.

Other snakes which are commonly confused with Schott's Whipsnakes, are best differentiated as follows; 

* Striped whipsnakes *M. taeniatus* are usually darker dorsally, and [the dark scales on top of the head are light colored at the edges](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/100473004?size=large) 
* *Thamnophis* gartersnakes have strongly keeled scales and an undivided anal scale
* *Salvadora* patchnose snakes have a distinctively enlarged, triangular rostral scale, 17 dorsal scale rows at midbody, and a prominent middorsal stripe which *M. schotti* lacks.
