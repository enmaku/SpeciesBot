Northwestern Gartersnakes *Thamnophis ordinoides* are small (30-61cm, record 96cm) New World natricine snakes that range across much of the Pacific Northwest, from SW British Columbia south through Washington and Oregon chiefly west of the Cascades and into extreme NW California. Scales are strongly keeled, and the anal plate is undivided.
 
*T. ordinoides* favors more open areas such as meadows, clearings and logged sections of woodland, old field and suburban backyards.  One of the most terrestrial gartersnakes and often found well away from water, it preys on slugs and earthworms but also takes amphibians.
 
When cornered/frightened, the northwestern garter snake, like many garter and water snakes, might flatten the head and body to make itself appear larger, bite or pretend to bite and release a foul smelling musk from the vent.  Mild toxins in the saliva are effective in subduing prey, but bites are considered harmless to humans.
 
Northwestern Gartersnakes share most of their range with the Common Gartersnake *T. sirtalis* and Western Terrestrial Gartersnake *T. elegans*.  In southern Oregon and NW California, the range also overlaps that of the Aquatic Gartersnake *T. atratus*.  Differentiating can be difficult, but the Northwestern garter snake has a proportionally smaller head than sympatric garter snakes. Additionally, they usually have-
• 7 upper labial scales
• 8-9 lower labial scales
• internasal significantly shorter than prefrontal scales
• posterior chin shields longer than anterior ones
• well defined dorsal stripe of highly variable coloration that runs roughly the length of the snake
• often have irregular reddish or dark colored spots or blotches along the venter
