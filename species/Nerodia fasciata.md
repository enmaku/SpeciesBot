Banded Watersnakes *Nerodia fasciata* are medium (90-110 cm record 158.8 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in and around water. They are commonly encountered fish and amphibian eating snakes across much of eastern North America.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

Found throughout southeastern North America, it is replaced in the North by, and likely exchanges genes with, the Common Watersnake *Nerodia sipedon*. Banded Watersnakes have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In common watersnakes *N. sipdeon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body. The "confluens" color pattern is somewhat of an exception to the even banding rule, but isn't often confused with other species as it is rather distinctive.

*Nerodia fasciata* along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the Southeastern US also exchange genes along environmental ecotones with Saltmarsh Snakes *Nerodia clarkii*.

This genus, as well as this species specifically, are in need of revision using modern molecular methods. Unfortunately what we know about this species is unpublished, but it's likely that it is composed of three species - a peninsular Florida species, a species west of the Mississippi River, and a continental eastern North American species.
