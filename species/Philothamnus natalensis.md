Western Natal Green Snakes *Philothamnus natalensis* are medium sized (70-100cm, up to 148cm), harmless colubrid snakes that range from southern Mozambique south through eastern Eswatini and far eastern South Africa, from near sea level up to 1,570m.  They chiefly inhabit well vegetated areas within lowland forest, moist savanna, and riparian corridors, especially near water, and can sometimes be common around areas of human habitation.
  
Diurnal and largely arboreal in habit, *P. natalensis* spend much of their time in trees and shrubs where they actively forage for frogs.  Lizards, small birds, and insects are also taken.  They are also good swimmers and can sometimes be found in water.

Like some other *Philothamnus* bush snakes, *P. natalensis* will [inflate their throats and/or bodies](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/49160585?size=large) when threatened, displaying the black skin in between their scales.  This behavior causes them to sometimes be confused with the venomous boomslang *Dispholidus typus*, but [boomslangs have very short heads with proportionally larger eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-spotted-bush-snake-vs-boomslang/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.  They are also commonly confused with green colored *Dendroaspis* mambas, but mambas grow to much larger sizes, are more robust in build, and [they have a more elongated and "coffin-shaped" head with proportionally smaller eyes](https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/articles/snake-comparison-eastern-natal-green-snake-vs-green-mamba/) than harmless *Philothamnus* spp.

Western Natal Green Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow, moderately elongate, and with moderately large eyes.  There are usually 9 supralabials with 5th and 6th in contact with the eye, a moderately elongate loreal scale, 1 preocular which does not contact the frontal, and 2 postoculars.  There is usually 2 (1-2) anterior temporal scale and 2 posterior temporals.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  The ventrals and subcaudals are laterally keeled.
