Western Stripe-Bellied Sand Snakes *Psammophis subtaeniatus* are medium-sized (70-100cm, up to 137cm), mildly venomous, psammophiid snakes that range from west-central Angola east to western Mozambique, south to northeastern South Africa and central Namibia, from near sea level to 1,500m.  They primarily inhabit dry savanna.

Rear-fanged snakes, *P. subtaeniatus* are mildly venomous, but generally considered harmless to humans.  Envenomation is uncommon and usually mild, but prolonged, chewing bites should be avoided as a precaution.  They are extraordinarily wary, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and harassed**.  Diurnal in habit, these active, swift moving, and vision-oriented hunters prey primarily on lizards.  Rodents, frogs, small birds, and snakes are also consumed.

Western Stripe-Bellied Sand Snakes have smooth scales arranged in 17 rows at midbody.  The head is narrow and elongate with large eyes.  There are usually 9 supralabials with 4-6 in contact with the eye, an elongate loreal, a preocular, and usually 2 postoculars.  The anal scale is divided.
