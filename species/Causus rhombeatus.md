Rhombic Night Adders *Causus rhombeatus* are small-medium (30-60cm, up to 95cm) true vipers that range from eastern Nigeria east into Ethiopia, south to extreme northwestern Namibia and the eastern and southern shores of South Africa from near sea level up to 2,200m.  They primarily inhabit moist areas within savanna, woodland, grassland, and scrub, especially near water.  They can also be common around areas of human habitation, including in suburban parks and gardens.  Despite the common name they can be active day or night.  Their main prey is toads and other frogs.

*Causus* night adders generally aren't considered a deadly animal, but are nonetheless dangerously venomous and should only be observed from a distance.  When frightened, individuals might flatten or inflate the body, hiss loudly, and/or strike toward the perceived aggressor.  Attempting to kill or capture the snake dramatically increases the risk of being bitten.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**
  
Rhombic Night Adders are moderately stout in build, with relatively short, slightly distinct or indistinct heads.  The dorsal scales are weakly keeled and usually arranged in 19 rows at midbody.  Unlike most other viperids, the top of the head is covered with large, plate-like scales.  There are 6-7 supralabials, which are separated from the eye by several subocular scales.  There is also a loreal scale, 2-3 preoculars, and 1-2 postoculars.  The anal scale is single, but the subcaudals are divided.
