Timber rattlesnakes *Crotalus horridus* are large (90-152cm, record 189cm), stout-bodied rattlesnakes that range from southern New Hampshire west to Minnesota, south to nothern Florida and south-central Texas.  They have been completely extirpated from Canada, and many populations in the Northeast and the Midwest have likewise been extirpated, leaving their distribution disjunct and patchy in those respective regions.  

In the northern and much of the western parts of their range, timber rattlesnakes are seasonally restricted to rocky slopes (hillsides, valleys, bluffs, etc.), heavily wooded further east, but semi-wooded or grassy further west.  They will utilize a wide variety of adjoining habitat during the summer, but don't stray too far, as they must return to their slopes before winter.  In the southeastern states, they they primarily inhabit riparian marsh, other grassy areas, and swamp.  Prey consists primarily of rodents, and they might play a vital role in [reducing the prevalence of lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses](https://research.umd.edu/news/news_story.php?id=7542).

Timber rattlesnakes are a dangerously venomous species and should only be observed from a safe distance.  Common defensive tactics including raising the forebody off the ground and rattling the tail, often while attempting to crawl away from the perceived threat.  They are not aggressive and only bite when they feel they are in danger.  Bites most commonly occur when a human attempts to kill, capture, or otherwise intentionally handle the snake.  **The best way to avoid being bitten is to leave the snake alone.**

Timber rattlesnakes are unlikely to be confused with other rattlesnakes.  The only other large rattlesnakes that overlap in range are the eastern diamonback rattlesnake, *C. adamanteus*, and the western diamondbacked rattlesnake, *C. atrox*.  Both can easily be differentiated from the timber rattlesnake by a pair of light colored lines on the face (running from the eye posteriorly toward the cheek or neck), diamond shaped dorsal blotches, and their different habitat preferences.
