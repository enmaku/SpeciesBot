The Mojave Rattlesnake *Crotalus scutulatus* is species of rattlesnake found in western North America. They are medium-sized (~100cm record 140 cm) venomous pit vipers that eat primarily small mammals.
 
Mojave rattlesnakes are dangerously venomous and will bite in self-defense, preferring to flee if given a chance. They will often raise their bodies off the ground and move away hissing loudly and rattling their tail as an anti-predator display.
 
The dorsal coloration of this snake varies tremendously over its range, though typically it is best characterized by diamond-shaped markings on a tan or brown base color with a black and white banded tail. Many animals will have a greenish tint. A similar species, the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake *Crotalus atrox* has many small scales between the eyes where *Crotalus scutulatus* has two or three. Other characters are subjective or not as consistent.
 
Counting segments in rattles is not an effective way to tell the age of a rattlesnake because snakes can shed more than once per year and grow a new segment with every shed. Rattles are easily broken off or damaged.
