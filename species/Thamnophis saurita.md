Eastern Ribbonsnakes *Thamnophis saurita* are small (<90 cm, record 101.8 cm) slender natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in aquatic habitats, including a wide variety of water bodies and wetlands, but they will utilize woodland, scrub, grassy areas, parks, and residential areas adjacent to water sources. They are commonly encountered generalist snakes across much of the North American continent and eat small invertebrates, fish, and amphibians, switching an otherwise diurnal habit to forage in the evenings and nights around amphibian breeding season.


*Thamnophis* gartersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They can deliver a weak venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are [not considered medically significant to humans](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/).

*T. saurita* can be differentiated from sympatric garter snake species by the combination of the following characteristics; a proportionally slender body and head, proportionally large eyes, unmarked, light colored labial scales, lateral stripes positioned on scale rows 3 & 4, and a small preocular light marking that contrasts with the darker coloration of the head.  The presence of 7 supralabials (upper lip scales), parietal spots that are either absent or less prominent and not touching, and the presence of ventrolateral stripes help differentiate them from the Western Ribbonsnake *T. proximus*, with whose range they overlap slightly near the Mississippi River and in the upper Midwest.

One of the widest-ranging snakes in North America, this species complex is almost certainly harboring unrecognized diversity and shows strong population structure at major biogeographic barriers (ie Mississippi River embayment and Peninsular Florida).

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods. For linguistic reasons, the specific epithet "sauritus" was changed to "saurita" [in 2016](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mu7ybubvxtyqb34/HR%20March%202016%20ebook.pdf?dl=1).
