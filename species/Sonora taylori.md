Groundsnakes *Sonora taylori* are small (21.5-30.6cm, record 48.3 cm) North American colubrine snakes with a limited range in southern Texas.  *Sonora taylori* are harmless to people and pets and rarely bite in self defense. They inhabit the semi-arid grasslands and scrub that characterize the South Texas Brush Country.  Semi-fossorial in habit, their diet consists of centipedes, spiders, scorpions, insects, and other invertebrates.

*Sonora taylori* lay eggs.  Their dorsal scales are smooth and glossy in appearance.  The anal scale is divided and a loreal scale is present on the face.  The presence of 13 scale rows at midbody differentiates it from the closely related *S. episcopa* and *S. semiannulata*.  This species, along with *S. episcopa* and *S. mosaueri*, was formerly included in *S. semiannulata*.
