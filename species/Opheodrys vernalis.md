Smooth Greensnakes *Opheodrys vernalis* are small (28-51cm, up to 81cm) harmless colubrid snakes with a heavily fragmented range from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick west into southern Saskatchewan, Canada, south into northern Virginia, and southwest into northeastern Utah and central New Mexico from near sea level up to 2,745m.  Populations seem to be declining, and they are now uncommon or even absent from some areas where they were once common.

Largely terrestrial, *O. vernalis* spend most of their time on the ground, generally only climbing into bushes and low vegetation.  They favor moist, grassy areas within open woodland, forest edges, prairie, meadows, scrubland, rocky hillsides, marshland, and alongside streams and other water bodies.  They can sometimes be common in suburban and even urban areas, where they typically inhabit abandoned farmland and vacant lots.  Chiefly diurnal in habit, their main prey is caterpillars, crickets, and grasshoppers. A wide variety of other insects, spiders and harvestmen, snails, slugs, and earthworms are also taken.

Adult *O. vernalis* are [bright green above](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/64066588?size=large), with a whitish or yellowish underside.  Hatchlings are [dull olive or grey dorsally](https://www.flickr.com/photos/146085654@N03/37679551142/).  They are moderate in build, with a proportionally small, stubby head.  They have smooth dorsal scales which are arranged in 15 rows at midbody.  The anal scale and subcaudals are divided.  

Racers *Coluber constrictor* can be greenish in some parts of their range, but are never as bright green as adult *O. vernalis*, and differ further by having 17 dorsal scale rows at midbody and by growing to much larger adult sizes.  Rough Green Snakes *O. aestivus* mostly do not overlap in range, but in the areas they do, can by easily differentiated by having keeled scales, a more slender body, and a narrow, elongate head.  Due to the rapid decomposition of yellow pigment, *O. vernalis* slowly turn blue in coloration after death.

Smooth Greensnakes are likely extirpated from small pockets they were once present, like Southeast Texas. There is strong population structure among what seem like [two diagnosable, independently evolving groups that meet in the North Forest](http://snakeevolution.org/images/Overnalisstructure.JPG).
