Boomslangs *Dispholidus typus* are medium-large (120-150cm, up to 200cm) dangerously venomous rear-fanged colubrid snakes that range from the coasts of Senegal and The Gambia east into Somalia, south to the southern shores of South Africa, from sea level to 2,400m.  They primarily inhabit savanna, open woodland, and scrubby areas with some trees, and can sometimes be found in disturbed areas, even in peri-urban zones where suitable habitat exists.

Boomslangs have a more efficient venom delivery system than most other rear-fanged snakes, and produce a potent venom that doesn't require prolonged chewing to be introduced in dangerous amounts.  Fortunately, they are shy, difficult to approach, and **bites rarely occur unless a snake is intentionally pursued and seized**.  When threatened, they often [inflate the throat to appear larger](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/37670939?size=large); in juveniles, the throat is often bright white or yellow, [enhancing the effect further](https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/119823766?size=large).  If pursued further, they rapidly flee, occasionally freezing motionless with the body kinked in order to look less snake-like and thus evade the pursuer. They are primarily diurnal in habit and spend most of their time in trees, where they prey primarily on lizards, especially chameleons, and small birds.  Rodents, frogs, snakes, and the eggs of birds and reptiles are also taken.

Long and slender in build, *D. typus* have long, gracile tails.  The dorsal scales are keeled and usually arranged in 19 rows (17-21) at midbody.  The head is somewhat small but distinct at the neck, with a short muzzle and distinctively large eyes.  There are usually 7 supralabials (7-8) with the 3rd and 4th in contact with the eye, a loreal scale, 1 preocular, and usually 3 (2-4) postoculars.  The anal scale is divided and the subcaudals are paired.
