There are a number of resources for snake ID and this list is nowhere near comprehensive.

Globally, comprehensive species lists are available via Reptile Database [Advanced Search](http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/advanced_search). Reptile Database is mostly correct and up to date in terms of taxonomy. Another worldwide resource is [Snakes of the World](https://www.crcpress.com/Snakes-of-the-World-A-Catalogue-of-Living-and-Extinct-Species/Wallach-Williams-Boundy/p/book/9781138034006) which, in addition to being comprehensive for extant snakes, also provides a wealth of information on fossil taxa.

Regional guides are useful. If you're in North America, the [Eastern Peterson Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Peterson-Reptiles-Amphibians-Eastern-Central/dp/0544129970) and [Western Peterson Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Peterson-Western-Reptiles-Amphibians-Fourth/dp/1328715507) are great tools, as is [Snakes of the United States and Canada](https://www.amazon.com/Snakes-United-States-Canada-Ernst/dp/1588340198). While [plagiarized and problematic](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Mendelson_Iii/publication/311993684_Review_of_Snakes_of_Mexico_volume_P_Heimes_author_by_J_R_Mendelson/links/5867e32c08ae329d620dfb40/Review-of-Snakes-of-Mexico-volume-P-Heimes-author-by-J-R-Mendelson.pdf), the book [Snakes of Mexico](https://www.amazon.com/Herpetofauna-Mexicana-Vol-Peter-Heimes/dp/389973100X) is the best easily accessible information for the region. For Central America, the [Kohler](https://www.amazon.com/Reptiles-Central-America-REVISED-2008/dp/3936180288) book as well as [Savage's Costa Rica book](https://www.amazon.com/Amphibians-Reptiles-Costa-Rica-Herpetofauna-dp-0226735389/dp/0226735389/) are excellent resources. South America is tough but has [a diagnostic catalog](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7868973). Australia has [Cogger](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/7845/) as a herp bible. SE Asia has two guides [one in German](https://www.amazon.com/Amphibien-Reptilien-S%C3%BCdostasiens-Wolfgang-Grossmann/dp/3931587126) and one [comprehensive](https://www.nhbs.com/a-field-guide-to-the-reptiles-of-south-east-asia-book). For Europe, you simply can't get better than the three volumes of [Handbuch der Reptilien und Amphibien Europas](https://www.nhbs.com/handbuch-der-reptilien-und-amphibien-europas-band-3i-schlangen-serpentes-i-book). Africa is also difficult - no comprehensive guide exists but there are a few good regional guides like [Reptiles of East Africa](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Reptiles-East-Africa/dp/0713668172/) and [Guide to the Reptiles of Southern Africa](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Reptiles-Southern-Africa/dp/1770073868/). [Amphibians and Reptiles of Madagascar](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Amphibians-Reptiles-Madagascar/dp/392944903X) is a good source for that distinct region. For the Indian subcontinent, use [Snakes of India](https://www.amazon.com/Snakes-India-Field-Romulus-Whitaker/dp/8190187309/) 

Remember, species names are hypotheses that are tested and revised - old books become dated by the nature of science itself. One of your best resources is going to be following /r/whatsthissnake, or (for North America) with the [SSAR Standard Names List](https://ssarherps.org/cndb/) for the most recent accepted taxonomic changes.
