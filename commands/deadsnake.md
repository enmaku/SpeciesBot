Please don't kill snakes - they are a natural part of the ecosystem and [even species that use venom for prey acquisition and defense are beneficial to humans](https://web.archive.org/web/20180802190346/https://umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/timber-rattlesnakes-vs-lyme-disease). One cannot expect outside to be sterile - if you see a snake you're probably in or around their preferred habitat. Most snakes are legally protected from collection, killing or harassment as non-game animals at the state level.

[Neighborhood dogs](http://livingalongsidewildlife.com/?p=3141) are more likely to harm people. Professional snake relocation services are often free or inexpensive, but snakes often die trying to return to their original home range, so it is usually best to enjoy them like you would songbirds or any of the other amazing wildlife native to your area. Commercial snake repellents are not effective - to discourage snakes, eliminate sources of food and cover; clear debris, stacked wood and eliminate rodent populations. Seal up cracks in and around the foundation/base of your home.
