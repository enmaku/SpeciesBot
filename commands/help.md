I am a bot created to help out here in /r/whatsthissnake. /u/Phylogenizer set me up with the goals of increasing the amount of information conveyed to people asking for identification help, to assist those interested in snake evolution and biogeography (SEB) in quickly accessing the most recent scientific publications concerning phylogeography and phylogenomics and to provide consistent up to date taxonomic information. Since my original debut here in /r/whatsthissnake in August 2018 (happy cakeday to me), I've expanded my functionality to /r/Herpetology, /r/Snakes, /r/Sneks and /r/Reptiles.

At my core, I am a keyword bot. One of my main functions is to reply with short species accounts of identified snakes. These species accounts are written by users of this subreddit - right now we're prioritizing information on North American species, as this is where more of our submissions come from. If you'd like to write a short species account, especially for species outside of North America, I invite you to submit your accounts to me using a [www.pastebin.com](https://www.pastebin.com) link in a private message. My species accounts are saved in text files and use the standard 'old reddit' markup characters. /u/Phylogenizer edits them to help curate and provide consistency. If you see anything wrong in an account, blame him not me, but do send a quick PM with your correction - we'll fix it.

My second main function is to reply to commands given by users, to invoke vetted information on snakes. These commands are useful and tailored to frequently asked questions in the subreddit. Commands are preceded by an exclamation point - you can see the full list below. If there's something you'd like to change or add, feel free to comment below and we'll try to work it in to the next update.

I am NOT a verification bot - just because you see me reply to a user does not mean I endorse that ID. I respond to anyone and everyone in my core subreddits (/r/Herpetology, /r/WhatsThisSnake, /r/Snakes) and to select commenters from these subreddits wherever they go on Reddit.

I also do some of the more monotonous tasks - for example, I can tell if someone has provided a geographic location properly, and if they haven't, I ask them, within thirty seconds of their post, to provide it and I explain why it is important - no humans needed. I also automatically reply to posts with the 'Dead Snake' flair to include some basic information on why killing snakes is not favorable. We save a lot of time and energy with this automation.

I concatenate responses and posts replies as a single comment. Nifty eh? You can use multiple commands and species names, and the bot won't clutter up the thread with a comment for each. This also applies to those of you the bot follows outside of the home subreddits. Where once it crashed the bot, now you are freed. It even puts a little line between entries. You're now only limited by how many characters a Reddit response can be. In the future, I hope to be able to respond automatically to much more. I'm still a baby in development. I will go up, down, and I will probably break a few times. Please be patient with me, and don't forget, you can help by writing well-sourced species accounts **in your own words** for species not on the list below.

Thanks!
