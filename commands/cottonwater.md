There are few things that can help differentiate between cottonmouths (*A. piscivorus*, *A. conanti*) and harmless water snakes (*Nerodia* spp.) once you learn to recognize them properly.  It's important to try to **apply as many keys as possible**; the more of these characteristics you can accurately identify, the more reliable your ID will be.  Underlined text links to pictures to help illustrate the keys.

1. Cottonmouths have a prominent, angular ridge along the top of the head, starting around the supraocular scale (directly above the eye) and running forward toward the snout ([side view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/francisg/781633459/), [front view](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dfc_pcola/46159931261/)).  This ridge protrudes outward, partially overhanging the eye like a brow, and gives the snake an annoyed or [grumpy looking appearance](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/21784039).  This also partially obscures the eyes when viewed [from above](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlyn_nature/11922670356/).  In water snakes, the supraocular scale does not overhang the eye, giving the animal a 'derpy' appearance [from the side](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdrimagestore/19767032301/) or [head on](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/31181955), and allows you to see most of the eye [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/49688336).

2. Cottonmouths have white or cream colored horizontal stripes or lines that run from [below the eye toward the corner of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/31766129@N08/38793934210/), and often another that runs from [behind the top of the eye toward the point of the jaw](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mirarr/32197116634/).  Water snakes do not.

3. Water snakes usually have [dark, vertical bars](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42389547@N00/4690698138/in/photolist-89v48Q-85DUpz) along the [edges of their labial scales](https://www.flickr.com/photos/144305930@N07/48800934783/).  Cottonmouths do not.

4. Cottonmouths and water snakes both darken with age, and the pattern is often obscured by the time they reach adulthood.  When the dorsolateral pattern IS visible, cottonmouths have bands that are usually wider at the bottom than on top; like pyramids in [side view](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), or hourglasses [from above](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/5477628).  In some individuals, the bands might be [broken](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20863027) or [incomplete](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/43217641), so this is not 100% diagnostic, but is still useful when used in conjunction with the other keys.  Water snakes exhibit a wide variety of patterns; most species aren't banded at all, and the ones that are banded have bands that are wider at the top, like [upside down triangles](https://www.flickr.com/photos/57809070@N03/10789857605/).

5. Adult cottonmouths often have a [noticeable dorsal ridge](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/41856310) along the vertebrae. This gives the body a [triangular appearance](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewtheus/11110609634/in/photostream/) in cross-section, which is especially noticeable in [underweight](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/20202718) or dehydrated animals, or when they initiate a [defensive display](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42272247@N07/21578345566/).  Water snakes, by contrast, are more cylindrical in cross-section.

6. Baby cottonmouths are born with [yellow or greenish tail tips](https://www.flickr.com/photos/josiah_townsend/4385588894/in/photostream/) (used to lure small prey) that fade as they age.  Young water snakes do not have these ([baby *N. sipedon*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/41710899@N08/8760068810/), [baby *N. rhombifer*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/30707198771/in/photostream/) for comparison).

7. Adult water snakes are fairly heavy-bodied, but cottonmouths of similar length tend to be significantly stouter. /n/n There are also some notable behavioral differences.  Water snakes often bask in branches and bushes overhanging water; this is uncommon in cottonmouths.  It is also true that water snakes often swim with the [body partially submerged](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100108154@N02/25613846737/), while cottonmouths usually swim with the [head held high and much of the body above the water line](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/50503400), but you can't rely on this characteristic alone; **each are fully capable of swimming the other way** and sometimes do so.  Water snakes are more likely than cottonmouths to dive underwater to escape danger.  When approached, water snakes are more likely to rapidly flee, whereas cottonmouths are more likely to slowly crawl away or simply stay still and hope not to be noticed.  If approached closely or cornered, water snakes are more likely to [flatten out their heads](https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfws_pacificsw/27564085765/in/photostream/) and/or [bodies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/91005472@N07/8494553139/) to appear larger and/or strike in the general direction of the person/animal they are cornered by, hoping to create enough space to escape.  Cottonmouths, on the other hand, are more likely to tilt their heads back (to a near vertical angle) and gape their mouths open, [displaying the white lining of the mouth](https://www.flickr.com/photos/169268909@N03/45916257755/) as a threat display, and vibrate their tails.

Bonus: two separate sets of cottonmouths [preying upon water snakes](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/44447911) that allow direct comparisons between [similarly sized animals](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/45546782), plus a picture of a [juvenile cottonmouth (bottom left)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaptainkory/6661143685/) with a juvenile common water snake (top) and a juvenile plain-bellied water snake (bottom right).
