Pupil shape should not be used in determining the presence of medically significant venom. Not only are there many venomous elapids with round pupils, there are many harmless snakes with slit pupils, such as [*Hypsiglena sp.* Nightsnakes](https://www.coloradosnakes.com/uploads/9/7/8/6/9786261/2776219_orig.jpg), [*Leptodeira sp.* Cat-eyed Snakes](https://previews.123rf.com/images/kjwells86/kjwells861802/kjwells86180200159/95840105-a-northern-cat-eyed-snake-leptodeira-septentrionalis-up-close-at-night-in-belize-.jpg), and even some common pet species such as [Ball Pythons](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/ba8eedc2-f544-4e9f-aa0b-dc2e773a013d/d2a6s0e-a355d8dc-a8f3-452f-aad8-d199f1c1a15f.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2JhOGVlZGMyLWY1NDQtNGU5Zi1hYTBiLWRjMmU3NzNhMDEzZFwvZDJhNnMwZS1hMzU1ZDhkYy1hOGYzLTQ1MmYtYWFkOC1kMTk5ZjFjMWExNWYuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.f3Er8L48O5xkZjpnufyvhj74QqCoASklxjPKdRRVeq4).

Furthermore, when eyes with slit pupils are dilated by low light or a stress response, the pupils will be round. As an example, while [Copperheads have slit pupils](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1628192/copperhead-snakes.jpg?w=1600&h=1200&l=72&t=40&q=88&f=cc296cc3e18d1641ec0c180e07c516e4), when dilated [the pupils will appear round](https://d1ti4rb4parwcs.cloudfront.net/monthly_2017_05/12879241333_6b5499a58e_z.thumb.jpg.1d01a9e58ee44c3e8399aa0c1deb837d.jpg).

Slit pupils are associated primarily with nocturnal behavior in animals, as they offer sensitivity to see well in low light while providing the ability to block out most light during the day that would otherwise overwhelm highly sensitive receptors. Slit pupils may [protect from high UV](https://brill.com/view/journals/ctoz/84/1/article-p1_1.xml?language=en) in [eyes that lack UV filters in the lens](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/33/10/2483/2925599?login=false). These functions are decoupled from the use of venom in prey acquisition and are present in many harmless species.
