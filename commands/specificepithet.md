Naming in biology follows a set of conventional rules. A species name has two parts. The first word, always capitalized, is the 'genus'. Take for example the Bushmaster, *Lachesis muta*. 'Lachesis' is the genus, a group of at least four charismatic, venomous, egg-laying pit vipers native to Central and South America. The second part, in our case 'muta', is the 'specific epithet', and is never capitalized. This particular specific epithet is 'muta' as in muteness, a reference to the this pit viper's rattle-less tail. With its granular, raised scales, the Bushmaster is reminiscent of a mute rattlesnake. The two words together form the species name, *Lachesis muta*. This name is also a species hypothesis about who is related to who - taxonomy reflects the evolutionary history of the group.
