The traditional color-based rhyme for coralsnakes isn't recommended as an identification trick as it isn't foolproof and only applies to snakes that live in parts of North America. See [this summary](http://thevenominterviews.com/2016/06/02/mythbusting-coral-snakes/) compiled by our own /u/RayInLA for more. It's far more advantageous to familiarize yourself with venomous snakes in your area through photos and field guides or by following subreddits like /r/whatsthissnake than it is to try to apply any generic trick.
