Snakes undergo a process called shedding or 'ecdysis' where old skin is shed in favor of a new, fresh layer of scales. During this process the old skin becomes dull, the belly may turn pink, and the eyes turn mostly opaque blue due to a build-up of fluid between the old and new spectacle. A few days before the skin is physically sloughed, the eyes become clear. When it comes time to shed, the snake will push or rub up against objects in the environment to hook the old skin on something and unroll it off of them like taking off a sock.
