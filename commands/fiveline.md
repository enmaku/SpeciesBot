The body plan of 'small skink with bright blue tail and yellow lines' is [adaptive](https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Plestiodon&species=elegans) [around](https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Trachylepis&species=margaritifera) the [world](https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Plestiodon&species=skiltonianus), so groups of distantly related species may look the same, a feature of evolution called convergence. While they can typically tell each other apart, closely related species can also look very similar with only subtle physical differences that humans have picked up on. For example, Southeastern North America has three sympatric lizards with juvenile forms sporting five yellow lines and a bright blue tail. The official common name for *Plestiodon laticeps* is Broadheaded Skink, *P. inexpectatus* is Southeastern Five-lined Skink and *P. fasciatus* is Five-lined Skink. *P. laticeps* would have 5 labial scales, *P. inexpectatus* and *P.fasciatus* have four. If you're trying to distinguish inexpectatus from fasciatus you have to then move on to the [scales around the vent](https://www.virginiaherpetologicalsociety.com/reptiles/lizards/southeastern-five-lined-skink/fivelinedskinks_tail.jpg). It helps to be discrete when speaking of these taxa; many aren't aware of the subtleties in natural history.
