Often confused with snakes, there are a [number of harmless limbless lizards with long fracturing tails](https://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/advanced_search?taxon=Anguinae&submit=Search) used as anti-predator devices. When seized, the tails shatter - hence the 'glass' namesnake. The most commonly encountered and asked about species, especially in Florida, is the Eastern Glass Lizard *Ophisaurus ventralis*. It has no pigment below a ridge along its side called a lateral groove. In Europe, the Slow Worm *Anguis fragilis* species complex is frequently observed in gardens and around homes.
