Snakes aren't known for 'aggression' or 'territoriality' but have developed impressive defensive anti-predator displays. Striking, coiling, hissing and popping are all defensive behaviors. The first line of defense in snakes is typically to hold still and rely on camouflage, or flee. Some species will move past people to get away - sometimes interpreted as 'chasing'. Cottonmouth snakes *Agkistrodon piscivorus* and *A. conanti* are among some species that may [aggressively flee](http://ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu/pdfs/Cottonmouth%20attack.pdf), but if you leave a safe distance between yourself, any snake and the snake's intended destination, there is no reason to expect to experience it.
