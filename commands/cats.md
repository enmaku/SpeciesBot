Everyone loves cats, but they belong indoors. Each year in the United States [free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.3-4.0 billion birds and 6.3-22.3 billion mammals](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380.pdf). Numbers for reptiles are similar in Australia, as [2 million reptiles are killed **each day** by cats, totaling 650 million a year](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett_Murphy/publication/325787707_How_many_reptiles_are_killed_by_cats_in_Australia/links/5b317b20aca2720785e837f1/How-many-reptiles-are-killed-by-cats-in-Australia.pdf). Outdoor cats are directly responsible for the extinction of at least 33 species worldwide and are considered one of the biggest threats to native wildlife. Keeping cats indoors is also better for them and public health - cats with outdoor access live shorter lives and are [2.77 times more likely to carry infectious pathogens](http://wilsonlab.com/publications/2019_BioLetters_Chalkowski_et_al.pdf).
